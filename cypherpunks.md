  > "The cost of maintaining one's privacy continues to rise as the cost of surveillance technology continues to fall. Most folks have neither the time nor the money to properly protect their privacy these days. Cypherpunks are the intolerant minority, the Spartans defending the pass."

* [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)
  > Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world."

I pick up the ringing phone. My writing partner, St. Jude Milhon, is shouting down the line: 'I’ve got it! Cypherpunk!'

'Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.' - Eric Hughes

* [The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html)
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. -Timothy C. May
