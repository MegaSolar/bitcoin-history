#### in chronological order

* [Untold History of Blockchain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/untold-history-blockchain-petri-basson/)
  - Phil Zimmerman creates PGP('91), the first publicly available encryption allowing people to communicate using 128-bit encryption and Diffie-Hellman for key management. Zimmerman published PGP code in book form to strengthen its case as freedom ofspeech. 
  - Open Source software development
  - Peer to peer sharing

* [The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html) 
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. -Timothy C. May ('92)

* [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) Eric Hughes ('93)
  > Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world."

* [Bernstein vs US Dept of Justice](https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice) (Decided in '96)
  >While a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, Bernstein completed the development of an encryption equation (an "algorithm") he calls "Snuffle." Bernstein wishes to publish a) the algorithm (b) a mathematical paper describing and explaining the algorithm and (c) the "source code" for a computer program that incorporates the algorithm. Bernstein also wishes to discuss these items at mathematical conferences, college classrooms and other open public meetings. The Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the ITAR regulatory scheme) required Bernstein to submit his ideas about cryptography to the government for review, to register as an arms dealer, and to apply for and obtain from the government a license to publish his ideas. Failure to do so would result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Bernstein believes this is a violation of his First Amendment rights and has sued the government.
