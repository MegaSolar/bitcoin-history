## NOTES

-inspired by a dicord conversation I decided to save and flesh-out my thoughts.

recap:
I was hearing some harsh criticism of other crypto projects from some who favor Ethereum, so I brought up how ethereum ignored like 20 years of research leading to smart contracts, similarly to how they ignored OG consensus research for the first few years of working on a, [so-called](https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-primer-on-blockchain-design-89605b287a5a), consensus mechanism ‚Äî PoS. 

at this point it came up about Bitcoin's resistance to all types of improvements.

Colored Coins paper, the rejection of which led to ethereum
http://bitpaper.info/paper/5722646637445120


>@infominer, Btw as we are talking about colored coins, did you also know that zcash also started as a bitcoin extension that never materialised. Also the reason why they moved to their own blockchain.
>Do you see a pattern here?

Response:

>>Zooko, founder of Zcash indeed acknowledges that ‚ÄúZcash is built on new, risky, unproven technology. It could have fatal flaws that we as scientists and engineers just haven‚Äôt discovered yet.‚Äù

Indeed i do üòπ

the (open source) liquid protocol provides a way for folk to experiment all kind, on top of layer 1

soon it will be another round of folk building every hairbrained, brilliant, and everywher between experiments without sacrificing the integrity of the blockchain

plus all the other blockchains that end up using that code

all in all i think it's a pretty solid ecosystem we've got going here.

<code>At this point I go off on a tangent since i've been studying the history of everything related to Bitcoin: currently the history of permissioned ledgers</code>

**--it's the same pattern**
1. Bitcoin comes and then a dozen or so others follow suit using its open source codebase as a starting point.
2. eris builds the first open source permissionable blockchain and permissionable version of the EVM trying to win a $100k bounty to replace the bitcoin foundation with some application
from there, between 2014-15 like 50 different permissioned ledger startups came out,  that whole sector being in consolidation phase from 2017-now (coming to the end of a falling wedge, as it were)
3. The rise of ethereum, and the 1000's of startups leveraging its protocol, now in consolidation with a couple years of the same to follow

and these waves are just going to keep coming and cascading w eachother, as new shit splashes new waves into it all

Now there are numerous projects, the pursuit of each supporting the education of the overall system, some of will go on to support the development of a number of any number of other systems ‚Äî the cross-pollination of which and the ultimate test of time will result in so much more than we can anticipate now.

* Bitcoin Liquid
* Bitoin Lightning
* Ethereum
* EOS
* NEO
* Decentralized Identity
* Hyperledger Foundation 
* Enterprise and State 
* the overall crypto ecosystem, really there are many more...

And before you say its all shit please tell me how you've done a deep dive on the entire ecosystem and the resulting encyclopedia you produced shows 0 value in any of that work but that came from one of your favored projects.

DPoS. for example, involves a measure of centralization that leaves them less centralized than the systems they seek to replace, and imo empowering anyone and everyone other than the establishment is super-cool.. less centralized corruption is better than more centralized corruption.

Cause you're using Microsoft Windows right now, and discord, and twitter, and *the social network that shall not be named* along with each of their subsidiaries.

Those supporting projects you don't like happen to also have some major personality disfuctions (just like everyone in the world):

>[@SarahJamieLewis](https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1074072327585816576) - Tim May was a racist, sexist, homophobic asshole who also captured the emergence of the crypto anarchist zeitgeist, and a testament to the principle that ideas should be judged on their merits and not on their authorship.

---

we got a good 10-15 years before the dust begins to settle

but from my perspective, all of these waves are occuring within the bitcoin ecosystem

ethereum and *everything* else is so much less mature.

---

in conclusion.. I am kinda happy there is one solid crypto that we all know won't change too much in the forseeable future.. we need a reliable way to short the fed.

and there is DOGE too, just in case the bitcoin apocalypse :stuck_out_tongue:
