### Introduction [**^**](#contents)

This repository is a space to gather any historical information about Bitcoin and related fields.

This readme currently contains pre-Bitcoin history, and there is a separate file for [cypherpunks](https://github.com/infominer33/bitcoin-history/blob/master/cypherpunks.md) info, [Bitcoin History](https://github.com/infominer33/bitcoin-history/blob/master/bitcoin-history.md), as well as the [History of Cryptocurrencies](https://github.com/infominer33/bitcoin-history/blob/master/cryptocurrencies.md). This repository is likely to grow, eventually to include individual files for various fields of knowledge.

* [The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323) - "Simon Singh offers the first sweeping history of encryption, tracing its evolution and revealing the dramatic effects codes have had on wars, nations, and individual lives. From Mary, Queen of Scots, trapped by her own code, to the Navajo Code Talkers who helped the Allies win World War II, to the incredible (and incredibly simple) logisitical breakthrough that made Internet commerce secure, The Code Book tells the story of the most powerful intellectual weapon ever known: secrecy."

  >In the Fall of 1974, as an undergraduate, I enrolled in CS244, the Computer Security course offered at UC Berkeley and taught by Lance Hoffman. We were required to submit two project proposals, one of which we would complete for the course. I submitted a proposal for what would eventually become known as Public Key Cryptography -- which Hoffman rejected. I dropped the course, but kept working on the idea.

### Cypherpunks [**^**](#contents)

* [Untold History of Blockchain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/untold-history-blockchain-petri-basson/)
  - Phil Zimmerman creates PGP, the first publicly available encryption allowing people to communicate using 128-bit encryption and Diffie-Hellman for key management. Zimmerman published PGP code in book form to strengthen its case as freedom ofspeech.
  - Open Source software development
  - Peer to peer sharing
* [Bernstein vs US Dept of Justice](https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice)
  >While a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, Bernstein completed the development of an encryption equation (an "algorithm") he calls "Snuffle." Bernstein wishes to publish a) the algorithm (b) a mathematical paper describing and explaining the algorithm and (c) the "source code" for a computer program that incorporates the algorithm. Bernstein also wishes to discuss these items at mathematical conferences, college classrooms and other open public meetings. The Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the ITAR regulatory scheme) required Bernstein to submit his ideas about cryptography to the government for review, to register as an arms dealer, and to apply for and obtain from the government a license to publish his ideas. Failure to do so would result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Bernstein believes this is a violation of his First Amendment rights and has sued the government.

  >Much has been published recently about the awesome promises of electronic commerce and trade on the Internet if only a reliable, secure mechanism for value exchange could be developed. This paper describes the differences between mere encrypted credit card schemes and true digital cash, which presents a revolutionary opportunity to transform payments. The nine key elements of an electronic, digital cash are outlined and a tenth element is proposed which would embody digital cash with a non- political unit of value.

* [Subject: RPOW - Reusable Proofs of Work](https://cryptome.org/rpow.htm)
  >This system receives hashcash as a Proof of Work (POW) token, and in exchange creates RSA-signed tokens which I call Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) tokens.  RPOWs can then be transferred from person to person and exchanged for new RPOWs at each step.  Each RPOW or POW token can only be used once but since it gives birth to a new one, it is as though the same token can be handed from person to person.

  > "Commercial security is a matter of solving the practical problems of business relationships such as privacy, integrity, protecting property, or detecting breach of contract. A security hole is any weakness that increases the risk of violating these goals. In this real world view of security, a problem does not dissapear because a designer assumes it away. The invocation or assumption in a security protocol design of a 'trusted third party' (TTP) or a 'trusted computing base' (TCB) controlled by a third party constitutes the introduction of a security hole into that design. The security hole will then need to be plugged by other means."

The concepts of money and value transfer have been evolving since primitive societies adopted shells and stones for monetary exchange, but the concept of digital money has been sought after for as long as there’s been an internet and peer-to-peer networking capabilities to drive its development."

  > We present an overview of the field of anonymous communications, from its establishment in 1981 from David Chaum to today. Key systems are presented categorized according to their underlying principles: semi-trusted relays, mix systems, remailers, onion routing, and systems to provide robust mixing. We include extended discussions of the threat models and usage models that different schemes provide, and the trade-offs between the security properties offered and the communication characteristics different systems support.

  > Today close to 90% of our financial transactions have a computer-only reality, no coins, and no bills. But the bits and bytes reflect national currencies defined as paper money equivalent. The next level in the increasing abstraction of credit, risk and value is to mint a currency natively defined as a string of bits. Bitdefined currency features the utmost flexibility in storage and movement, as well as in reflecting value, risk, and credit distribution.
