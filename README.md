# Coming soon, more Bitcoin Info than you can shake a stick at.

We have 4 Bitcoin related Discord servers to organize information on various topics related to Bitcoin, and make a nice space for Bitcoin away from all of the noise of the crypto scene.

Discord Servers: (information sorted in channels\category\server by topic)
  * [Bitcoin Nerds](https://discord.gg/nxcACHc)
  * [Lightning Network Info](https://discord.gg/2c4Sd7u)
  * [Bitcoin History](https://discord.gg/Evk84Kk)
  * [Practical Bitcoin](https://discord.gg/8pwmz8j)

Soon all of that will be published via this repository.

## Bitcoin History
**Cryptography, Cypherpunks, Virtual Currencies, P2P, Distributed Systems and Smart Contracts.**

I moved all of the content to [_pages](_pages) and [_posts](_posts)

I think that will make it easier for github visitors to navigate.
