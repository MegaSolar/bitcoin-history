## NOTES


>@infominer, Btw as we are talking about colored coins, did you also know that zcash also started as a bitcoin extension that never materialised. Also the reason why they moved to their own blockchain.
>Do you see a pattern here?

My super long response:

>Zooko, founder of Zcash indeed acknowledges that “Zcash is built on new, risky, unproven technology. It could have fatal flaws that we as scientists and engineers just haven’t discovered yet.”

indeed i do :joy_cat:
the (open source) liquid protocol provides a way for folk to experiment all kind, on top of layer 1
soon it will be another round of folk building every hairbrained, brilliant, and everywher between experiments without sacrificing the integrity of the blockchain

plus all the other blockchains that end up using that code

all in all i think it's a pretty solid ecosystem we've got going here

**--it's the same pattern**
1. Bitcoin comes and then a dozen or so others follow suit using its open source codebase as a starting point.
2. eris builds the first open source permissionable blockchain and permissionable version of the EVM trying to win a $100k bounty to replace the bitcoin foundation with some application
from there, between 2014-15 like 50 different permissioned ledger startups came out,  that whole sector being in consolidation phase from 2017-now (coming to the end of a falling wedge, as it were)
3. The rise of ethereum, and the 1000's of startups leveraging its protocol, now in consolidation with a couple years of the same to follow

---

and these waves are just going to keep coming and cascading w eachother, as new shit splashes new waves into it all
(oh yeah, that reminds me about fucking ripple ruining one of the best symbols)
we got a good 10 years at least before the dust begins to settle
but from my perspective, all of these waves are occuring within the bitcoin ecosystem
ethereum and everything else is much less mature.. (obvs since ethereum will try out a new consensus soon)

---

in conclusion.. I am kinda happy there is one solid crypto that we all know won't change too much in the forseeable future
and there is DOGE too, just in case the bitcoin apocalypse :stuck_out_tongue:
