* http://www.merkle.com/1974/ 
  >In the Fall of 1974, as an undergraduate, I enrolled in CS244, the Computer Security course offered at UC Berkeley and taught by Lance Hoffman. We were required to submit two project proposals, one of which we would complete for the course. I submitted a proposal for what would eventually become known as Public Key Cryptography -- which Hoffman rejected. I dropped the course, but kept working on the idea.

* [Untold History of Blockchain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/untold-history-blockchain-petri-basson/)
  - Phil Zimmerman creates PGP, the first publicly available encryption allowing people to communicate using 128-bit encryption and Diffie-Hellman for key management. Zimmerman published PGP code in book form to strengthen its case as freedom ofspeech.
  - Open Source software development
  - Peer to peer sharing


* [Bernstein vs US Dept of Justice](https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice)
  >While a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, Bernstein completed the development of an encryption equation (an "algorithm") he calls "Snuffle." Bernstein wishes to publish a) the algorithm (b) a mathematical paper describing and explaining the algorithm and (c) the "source code" for a computer program that incorporates the algorithm. Bernstein also wishes to discuss these items at mathematical conferences, college classrooms and other open public meetings. The Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the ITAR regulatory scheme) required Bernstein to submit his ideas about cryptography to the government for review, to register as an arms dealer, and to apply for and obtain from the government a license to publish his ideas. Failure to do so would result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Bernstein believes this is a violation of his First Amendment rights and has sued the government.

* [Subject: RPOW - Reusable Proofs of Work](https://cryptome.org/rpow.htm)
  >This system receives hashcash as a Proof of Work (POW) token, and in exchange creates RSA-signed tokens which I call Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) tokens.  RPOWs can then be transferred from person to person and exchanged for new RPOWs at each step.  Each RPOW or POW token can only be used once but since it gives birth to a new one, it is as though the same token can be handed from person to person.
