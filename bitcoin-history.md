Description = "Us old-timers always considered a decline greater than 80% to be a bubble that popped. Most altcoins must be legitimately considered as bubbles that popped. The dead-cat bounces from the resulting decimation can be wicked."

Description = "The history of Bitcoin has been a turbulent one to say the least, and right now we're in one of the most turbulent periods in its history, as it has spent the entirety of 2018 falling further and further from its peak value of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.\n\nBut something as uncertain as Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) was never going to be smooth sailing. Many tried a cryptographed digital currency before it, and they weren't able to fully crack it. Since Bitcoin became a reality nearly a decade ago, there have been some high highs and some low lows. For some Bitcoin owners, that's part of the appeal.\n\nBut how did we get to where we are today with Bitcoin? How did it begin, what were its forebearers, and what have been the unexpected turns of the Bitcoin journey? Let's take a walk through the timeline and find out."

["Visions of Bitcoin—How major Bitcoin narratives changed over time"]
Link = ["https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c"]
Description = "Perhaps the most enduring source of conflict within the Bitcoin community derives from incompatible visions of what Bitcoin is and should become. Businesses building on Bitcoin, believing it a cheap global payments network, eventually became nonviable when blocks filled up in 2017. They weren’t necessarily wrong, they just had a vision of the world that ended up being a minority view within the Bitcoin community, and was ultimately not expressed by the protocol on their desired timeline."

Description = "The small band of early bitcoiners all shared the communitarian spirit of an open source software project. Gavin Andresen, a coder in New England, bought 10,000 bitcoins for $50 and created a site called the Bitcoin Faucet, where he gave them away for the hell of it. Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida programmer, conducted what bitcoiners think of as the first real-world bitcoin transaction, paying 10,000 bitcoins to get two pizzas delivered from Papa John’s. (He sent the bitcoins to a volunteer in England, who then called in a credit card order transatlantically.) A farmer in Massachusetts named David Forster began accepting bitcoins as payment for alpaca socks"
