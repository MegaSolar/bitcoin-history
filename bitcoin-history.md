* [@lopp on Bitcoin History](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1023689161096785920) - Bitcoin whitepaper purists should take note that the following things are NOT described in the whitepaper: 
  * multisig
  * mining pools
  * 21M coin cap
  * GPU & ASIC mining
  * 10 minute block times
  * HD address generation
  * best chain = cumulative PoW, not longest chain
  * and much, much more..


* [@PeterLBrandt on 'Bubbles'](https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1030884169763549184) - Us old-timers always considered a decline greater than 80% to be a bubble that popped. Most altcoins must be legitimately considered as bubbles that popped. The dead-cat bounces from the resulting decimation can be wicked.

  > "The history of Bitcoin has been a turbulent one to say the least, and right now we're in one of the most turbulent periods in its history, as it has spent the entirety of 2018 falling further and further from its peak value of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.\n\nBut something as uncertain as Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) was never going to be smooth sailing. Many tried a cryptographed digital currency before it, and they weren't able to fully crack it. Since Bitcoin became a reality nearly a decade ago, there have been some high highs and some low lows. For some Bitcoin owners, that's part of the appeal.\n\nBut how did we get to where we are today with Bitcoin? How did it begin, what were its forebearers, and what have been the unexpected turns of the Bitcoin journey? Let's take a walk through the timeline and find out."

  >"I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell."
