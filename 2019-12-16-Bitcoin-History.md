I won’t discuss anything in this post. I’m tired of discussing technical things with people with skewed opinions and monetary interest. I’ve talked enough in the Bitcointalk forum…

**An Analysis of Anonymity in the Bitcoin System**

Fergal Reid University College Dublin, Ireland Martin Harrigan University College Dublin, Ireland

Anonymity in Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electroniccurrency system, is a complicated issue. Within the system,users are identified by public-keys only. An attacker wishingto de-anonymize its users will attempt to construct the one-to-many mapping between users and public-keys and associateinformation external to the system with the users. Bitcoinfrustrates this attack by storing the mapping of a user to hisor her public-keys on that user’s node only and by allowingeach user to generate as many public-keys as required. In thispaper we consider the topological structure of two networksderived from Bitcoin’s public transaction history. We showthat the two networks have a non-trivial topological structure,provide complementary views of the Bitcoin system and haveimplications for anonymity. We combine these structures withexternal information and techniques such as context discoveryand flow analysis to investigate an alleged theft of Bitcoins, which,at the time of the theft, had a market value of approximatelyhalf a million U.S. dollars.

**Base plan includes:**

>

Your own 'yourname.vekja.net' subdomain.

One 'yourname@vekja.net' email address, accessible via SSL/TLS encrypted IMAP or POP3 with 100MB of storage.

Hosted on Quad core Xeon machines with Raid 1 storage connected via 100Mb/sec ports in the highly connected NAC (www.nac.net) datacenter in New Jersey, USA.

Secure, encrypted access (SFTP / TLS / SSL / HTTPS) to every service that we provide (Web root upload access, Email, Etc). You are welcome to connect to us via TOR.

No storage of any information that can compromise your identity (Ie. IP addresses); thus, even in the event of a supoena, your anonyminity is protected.

>

**Additional Options:**

>

Proxy-purchasing* of domain names, SSL certificates, Etc.

Upgrades will always be availble at cost.

If we see even moderate interest in this service we will improve the service by dedicating programming resources to add a panel, webmail, Etc -- any features users request. These would be provided at no extra cost since we just program them once.

Other ideas? Just ask! We want your business as we want money to flow so that the Bitcoin economy reaches critical mass!

It’s a bubble, but it’s an unbreakable bubble, one that is just going to keep growing and growing and growing … It’s kind of like the early days of the dot-com. People heard about this thing called the Internet and they didn’t know what it was, didn’t know what to do, so they bought every [stock] that ended in a dot-com and of course they all lost their shirts. This is kind of like this, but you actually can buy a piece of it, like the Internet but you can own a piece of it.

**2011-2-7 - Escrow Trading Open**

Six more currency pairs are available. These are for escrow trading (the counter currency is sent directly from the buyer to the seller). There is also an option to accept open orders for escrow currency pairs directly. To do so, select 'Accept An Existing Order' on the 'My Orders' tab.

>

**2011-2-1 - Going Live!**

Real trading of BMBTC/BMUSD and BMBTC/BMGAU is now available!

>

**2011-1-13 - More testing needed**

More testing is needed. I'd like to have real trading functional for two currency pairs by the end of January. These will be 'BMBTC/BMUSD' and BMBTC/BMGAU'. Recent changes to order validation... Accounts may go negative after executing trades, but every attempt is made to prevent this. If an account goes negative, another order must be placed to bring it above negative. Otherwise, withdraws and payments are disabled for all accounts. Numerous changes have been made to the code for easier configuration. Some new bugs may be present.

>

**2011-1-4 - Changed currency pairs**

Merged the processor to the currency pair as a two character prefix. Hopefully, this will make sense. An explanation is here. Added a basic order form, but I'm still seeking input on how it should look and what it should have. Need testing for Stop and Stop Limit order types. I reset most of the database.

>

**2011-1-1 - Now Beta Testing**

The top priorities... Hunting down possible exploits, check input validation, fix basic bugs, and enhance the user interface. If you'd like to help, contact us directly or ask another member for an invitation.

Bitcoin Cash, to be available Aug. 1, sprang from a feud over how to govern a decentralized, open-source technology with no one set of leaders or owners.

In August, the bitcoin world split in two when bitcoin cash broke away from bitcoin. It was the culmination of years of growing tension about how to improve the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. The divide has set up a battle over which is the “true” bitcoin, pitting rivals whose combined market value has eclipsed that of Citigroup Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.
