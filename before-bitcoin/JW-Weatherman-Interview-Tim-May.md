## Transcript:

Alright! Thanks for joining me for another episode of under the microscope with JW weathermen. Today, I'm joined by the the famous and awesome Timothy C May, couldn't be more excited to have him. 

As a quick introduction: by the mid 80s Tim was already famous for solving something called the alpha particle problem when he was working at Intel and then in the early nineties he and a few friends founded the cypherpunk movement, and that's responsible for a lot of the freedom that we enjoy today. 

They really fought and won the crypto Wars in the 90s and for me and a lot of other folks that's really a turning point in history where we headed from you know what was probably gonna be a fairly dystopian future, to one where I can see a lot of individual liberty on the horizon. 

I've been looking forward to talking to Tim for more than a few years now and I can't thank you enough for joining me here

> so good to be here 

Good deal. A lot of my audience will have seen the talk that you gave in hackers congress last year, so I kind of see this as a follow up to that, in that you referenced Ayn Rand and what were the major influences that brought you... would you consider yourself an ancap [anarcho-capitalist]?  I think you've used that term...

>I don't really call it call myself an ancap or anything like that. I was influenced by Rand, obviously. Even before Rand, I was influenced by Robert Heinlein, things like The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Very libertarian oriented, often talked about free zones. Larry Niven also wrote about this too in the late 1960s, but I'd heard of Ayn [pronounded like "Eye"-n] Rand for a long time. 

>Everybody, I mean, it was very much in the air in the 1960s every college student was reading Atlas Shrugged at that time far cry from today with the V for Vendetta type people. In the summer of 1968 I guess I was 16 years old at the time I found a copy of Atlas Shrugged at the library, and checked it out, and read it in three days.  I did skip the 60 pages of John Galt speech, somewhere in there, and ironically... I mean I have a couple of hardback copys someplace, but I've been unable to read it since. 

>yeah so that's a long long time but I can't get past page three. I mean it's just prose...

It's awful. It's just the worst. I've tried to read that book probably four times and I just can't get through more than a chapter to the characters are so wooden and unrelatable 

>yes but to a 16 year old it was very exciting... and I read it straight through, like I said, three days... and that's all I could think about and when I returned to school the following September. I had a teacher, political science teacher, who was somewhat Republican, libertarian, this is before the name libertarian really took hold... and she patiently listened to my rants. 

>I would write essays about gold and economic freedom and what not... heavily influenced by Rand, and obviously, then I read The Fountainhead, Capitalism and the Unknown Ideal, bunch of stuff like that... and that was a big influence, but then by the time I was in college a bunch of us lived in a shared suite... eight of us, seven of us, were libertarians, a couple of them became famous mathematicians, professors, that sort of thing. 

>They're all about my age of course but we would talk about all these things we would hatch over the the tired old themes of, what if you're falling from a an apartment building and you need to land on someone's balcony but you don't have permission to land on that balcony. Are you obligated to fall to your death, or can you trespass on that property. You know, the lifeboat type things, 

exploring the fringes of private property, and where can violate them and not

>yeah right right right... and you said something in a couple of your pieces that I was heavily influenced by Murray Rothbard. I may have mentioned Rothbart. For a New Liberty was out at that time, I think I skimmed a few chapters of it and it's like a lot of things. it's preaching to the converted I had a Reason subscription I had a Liberty Magazine, defunct now for about one year, but it's all just preaching to the to the already converted... didn't tell me anything I didn't already know

>same thing with Von Mises and Hayek, certainly important stuff. Karl Popper, you know, the whole circle of these people but at some point it just gets very very repetitive and I became much more interested in practically implementing some of these ideas. we can get to that in a few minutes if you want to...

Yeah I'm very excited to talk about that. I can't I can't remember if it was the hackers Congress where you referenced him or not and I that's one of the reasons I've been looking forward to talking to you especially after talking with Jim Bell. I think looking back over history, I assume that it's a lot more clean and linear and I look back at guys like Murray Rothbard, as being kind of a pivot point where people really picked up on the idea of a private law and private security 

>but you know, looking back I may I may be overestimating it maybe it was a lot more in the air and there were a lot of folks more folks talking about it. I don't feel like Ayn Rand really covered that very well except for when she was interacting with Murray Rothbard.

>Yeah I don't know the details. I know that in the early 1970s when when we were debating this stuff in our college dorm there was a all sorts of goings-on with Nathaniel Branden,and splits in the Objectivist movement, and I never considered myself an Objectivist. I don't even accept the logic of "a is a" but that's an extreme subtlety that I won't get into, having to do with non-standard logic which has been my interest for about 10 years now. Quantum mechanics and that sort of stuff.

>yeah so I worked for Intel for a while, and then I left, and I've never worried too much about inflation of the dollar. I know you talk about that a lot. Fundamentally I keep my assets in *assets*, namely stocks, bonds, that sort of thing and so the dollar dropped in value.. but these assets keep on rising.

>People in Weimar Germany, for example, who had their money in real estate art stocks and bonds tended to do okay, but by the late 1940s they had recovered. The real disaster was people on fixed incomes, pensions for example, or who had their money just sitting in a bank account and and the Reichsmark became essentially worthless over time right?

yep yeah if you if you have the time and the expertise to make investment decisions you can navigate it, but there's a lot of people that are... especially less wealthy people, those are the ones that get hurt the hardest... not to mention that... just the disaster on the economy, of the boom and bust cycle that were constantly going through.. 2008..

>or passing this 1.3 trillion dollar omnibus bill with all sorts of bad things in it, that wasn't even written until the day before it was signed.

I think there's probably some war spending that's coming our way too that's the reality.. so back when you were when you were in college there was a lot of folks talking about this, you went to Intel you you were obviously a very competent technologist and became well known from that... and then in the early 90s you really got interested from reading a bunch of science fiction and other stuff, about trying to implement a libertarian reality in cyberspace and eventually maybe that could bleed into the real world. 

How do you feel looking back on it? I mean it's been a long time. I talk to people now that are they're either very optimistic or very pessimistic in general, and it seems like the younger they are the more pessimistic they are. They've grown up with the revelations of Snowden and the NSA, and they just feel like things are just constantly getting worse. how do you how do you feel about it? 

>at this point I'm phlegmatic about it. I'm very much a believer in Greek philosophy, stoicism, skepticism etc etc... what will be will be. It just is what it is. Some things are getting better, some things are getting worse. 

Do you feel like if you were to predict the next 30 years, do you think that we're looking at more of a 1984? The argument for that, is that everything is recorded all the time. We're a turnkey totalitarian state, but the other hand, we have stuff like Bitcoin that looks promising. Do you do you feel like it's leaning one way or the other, at this point?

>you know I don't get interviewed all that often, but one of the last interviews I did, someone said "you were so precient and seeing things from the 1990s that would come about and many of those things have come about, what do you think will happen in the future?" and I said I have absolutely no idea whatsoever. My crystal ball is dark. 

fair enough. that's a good a good enough answer

>no I don't know what's going to happen. Things seems so clear in 1988 to 94, thereabouts.. and I mean it was clear where several technological trends would happen. I was very active on the Internet of course I had my first primitive DARPA account in 1973. It was very primitive. My campus was one of the first nodes on the ARPANET, so yeah I had an account. Very primitive, but by the time I left Intel in 86, the seeds of the modern Internet were being born and I got my first commercial account in 1988. I guess it was when the ARPANET was opened up to civilians and ISPs began to form.

At that point you were pretty confident that we were going to have a sort of a libertarian world inside cyberspace within the next 10 20 years. Was that fair to say?

>yeah I had a huge amount of spare time on my hand. I would go down to the beach almost every day, sit in my beach chair with a beer and read. Yeah, and I had read James Bamford's [The Puzzle Palace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/804860.The_Puzzle_Palace), came out in about 1983 or thereabouts. It was essentially an encyclopedic work on the history of the NSA, and most of us had not even heard of the NSA at that time, we barely heard about it. My father was in the Navy and I talked to him at the time and said dad did you know of a thing called the National Security Agency. He said oh yeah we just couldn't talk about it "No Such Agency" it was already a huge surveillance operation by then 

>so Bamford describes, and it's on the inside cover quotations the blurbs... saying if a Russian general is meeting with his mistress in a car, NSA can hear what they're talking about. If a broker in Switzerland is phoning London to make a
transaction, NSA knows about it. So this got my gears turning. I began to think about... what if, for example, the NSA was running, essentially, a large private hedge fund with intercepted communications? We now know they did. In fact, this is during the Iran-contra thing. Oliver North and company.. Admiral Poindexter and Oliver North were centrally trading drugs to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. 

>so I began to think about the implications of widespread surveillance and it happened that a friend of mine, this is covered in a lot of detail, was putting together a company sort of like an eBay for information the American information
exchange. Phil Salon, the late Phil Salon, he died in the early 1990s around 91, was a student of Friedrich Hayek and had met Hayek had framed photos of himself and Hayek... and he was always reading these Austrian economics sorts of things
and was he was involved with the George Mason University people... there's a whole Institute of Individual Liberty, there still is, a lot of leading Austrian economics people. 

>so Phil was in contact with them, and he invited me to drive over to his place. He and his wife rented a place in Menlo Park or Redwood City... so I went over there and he outlined the idea for the American Information Exchange, the idea would be that someone would request information on say the best type of sailboat to buy to do a certain thing, and said I'll pay $50 for this. They could have been eBay, essentially. eBay did the same thing except they were selling Pez dispensers and toys and knickknacks.

>so Phil's idea was to buy and sell information, information of a question-and-answer sort. Which has never really taken off. There are a few minor little efforts to do these things but they haven't really gone too far, and it's not hard to see why. It's hard to frame question properly, it's hard to know the quality of answer one is getting from random people on the
Internet, and at that time the internet was crude. I had to dial in after midnight with a 1200 baud modem to get someplace.  It was very primitive in those days. It was an idea ahead of its time, and then Autodesk the AutoCAD company funded Amex as well as Xanadu the hypertext company they funded - two of these companies and both failed and dissipated and people scattered to other projects.

>but I went over there in December in 1987. I've been retired from Intel for a little over a year and a half at that point. Phil outlined his company, this is covered in the Prague conference a year ago... and I immediately began to see flaws in this, namely people would buy and sell the most valuable information there is, which is corporate information

right, secrets, things that are illegal, not [...] consumer reports magazine... 

>and Phil said, then we would ban this from people using it at work. I said well then they'll go home and use America online or whatever and do it that way. he says, well then we'd require identity. I said well people will pseudonyms ... etc etc... and then the sticking point was how do you pay for this? and this was the unsolved problem, squaring the circle is not solved until the solution of the Byzantine generals problem with Bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus.

things that I wondered about was things like reputation and all the problems that would prevent buying and selling of information to work, I mean even even simple problems like spam, they really required electronic cash and now that we have a functional electronic cash system... by the way what I was expecting you to say is it got very frustrating because it seemed like things paused from early 2000 maybe late 90s all the way up till 2008... but then there was a breakthrough and how we're feeling more optimistic, that's the linchpin. 

not to put words in your mouth, but is how much is that sort of your feel? that this really is a key moment that's gonna unlock the other stuff? or how much of it is just another piece of the puzzle, and we still have a lot of work to do?

>I think we have a lot of work to do but I certainly think 2008 to 2010 was a big turning point and obviously there are now a zillion alternate forms of ecash like Z-cash, Monero, etc.. right which of those will win out? I don't know.

Have you stayed in touch with, well I guess first I'll ask how connected were you with David Chaum and Adam Back and Wai Dai and Nick Szabo and all those guys that would kind of associate with the history of electronic cash? Where you guys all friends hanging out regularly or was a little more disconnected than that.

>for example in around 1988 when when I was first working on these ideas I spent a lot of time talking with Phil Salen as I told you. We actually arranged a road trip, up to Berkeley, to meet with David Chaum, and this is in 1988.. yeah so I've met Chaum at the the crypto conference, and I'd also met him in person up in Berkeley, and then on a panel with him in 95 and Monte Carlo... He lives down in Southern California, he lived in Holland at the time but he now lives in Woodland Hills which is a suburb of LA, yeah he came to a couple of cypherpunks meetings... also David Friedman came to a couple 

>we were I've covered this before we were in a grubby rented apartment in Oakland that Eric Hughes was renting unfurnished at the time and Friedman came, and I think he was pretty skeptical of the ideas he was sort of bemused by the
enthusiasm a lot of us he came around though and and he probably have seen
he's dedicated some of his books to these ideas yeah and it says Tim Tim
stole ideas for me I stole ideas from him that's the way it works right right
I would say Friedman was a bigger influence on me than Rothbard example okay that's a trial as with Jim Bell you
know the machinery of freedom that's a more core value than say for a new
Liberty which was just you know preaching to the converted
right interesting like a lot of books of that time like it Jerome to Co wrote a
book called he usually begins with iron rant yeah there were several of these
books that were out at the time Anna libertarian party formally started in
1972 I voted for the first libertarian candidate John Hosparus even before the
libertarian party formerly existed right now that was another kind of a line of
questions that I had for you was it seems like one of the things that the
cyberpunk movement did is it it really focused on technology and tools how
right how do you feel like that is still the best strategy as compared to like politics yes or general education or economic yeah yeah we used to have people periodically in the cypherpunks list who were enthusiastic about setting
up card tables at conferences and I was sort of seen as the great skeptic I
would say knock yourself out I'm not gonna sit at a card table in San Jose
and harangue people I'd seen that at at Santa Barbara where people would set up
card tables and try to can persuade people and they're never
persuaded and when you say ever our card tables are we talking about just general
education or like a political campaign political campaign I don't mean for
candidates but I mean sitting at a card table handing out libertarian propaganda
right you know getting into the same arguments about the limits of personal
liberty it cetera what uh what happened in eighty eight with with meeting with
Phil sale and as I sketched out the ideas that became the crypto anarchist
manifesto and I was on a roll at this time because I had all the time in the
world to sit and think about these things
and there were no distractions there was no Twitter no Facebook no Bitcoin
conferences every week you know none of that
where people are constantly in an in an echo chamber bouncing ideas back and
forth bouncing one line representing forth I have plenty of time to
contemplate this and like you did I read your Bitcoin threats outline or I
skimmed it wow thanks it's written in an outline
form you probably noticed my cyphernomicon is humongous outline yep you
know written in the earliest outline
processor but called more which was by
the guy who later invented the term blog
and also invented RSS nice Dave Winer so
I tend to think that way then I can
attach ideas to different themes it
makes for a messy structure but it's
better than just trying to write some
fully well you know what I'm saying yeah
yeah it was sort of a bullet point
structure so that you got a systematic
layout of ideas rather than trying to
you know put all the verbage around it
paragraph form right right yeah yeah so
uh what happened is I started developing
these ideas and I was meeting with a
libertarian acquaintance of mine from
college who had reconnected with in
early eighty eight I guess it was and we
were moaning the fact that there had
been no good libertarian novel along the
lines of Atlas Shrugged nothing that
incorporated new information ran for
example had the stranger
you could get a bunch of
anarcho-capitalists would move to a
valley in Colorado someplace which had
some sort of science fictiony electronic
screen over the top that would prevent
planes from seeing down what was
happening and people would walk around
trading gold pieces with each other and
you know all the big shots the John Galt
sand Hank Rearden's all all the
characters from Rand's novel would be
essentially anarcho-capitalist ik
trading with each other right and
somehow managed it really clearly they
didn't have problems with private
defense and trade embargoes and
everything just worked right but it
seemed possible that that it would be
feasible to create a kind of Galt's
Gulch in cyberspace right so very much
in the air at that time was for example
Neuromancer William Gibson true names
Vernor Vinge II Anders gain Orson Scott
Card which was made into a fairly lousy
movie a few years ago it involves
characters students pseudonymous late
communicating with each other so anyway
these ideas were current so Eric Hughes
very brilliant mathematician younger
than me was maybe 30 years at the time I
was maybe 36 38 at the time ah came out
to Santa Cruz he was considering
enrolling as a grad student at UC Santa
Cruz so we wanted to look over the
rental market and see if how feasible it
would be any stayed at my place his
brother was with him but Eric and I
ended up spending three days instead of
him looking for a place to rent we
talked about all these things he had
just spent several months working for
David Chow in Holland it seemed it was a
rite of passage nick szabo did the same
thing Eric Hughes did the same thing and
a third guy I forget who it was but he
also worked as a intern for Tom's
company digit cash so Eric and I talked
about everything everything about
computational feasibility about
np-complete problems about cryptography
etc and we both sort of had the same
I can't remember whose idea it was that
we should call together some of the
smartest people we knew in the Bay Area
and we knew a lot of these people
because there were three or four
intersecting groups a science-fiction
group a a group connected with mondo
2000 and the early or early work on the
well which turned into Wired magazine
and so we knew a lot of these people and
the hackers conference we knew some of
the people from this so we ended up
having a meeting in September and about
25 people showed up and it was all
all-day type of thing at that time I
happen to know more about cryptography
than most of the people in the room
because it wasn't as ocorant as it is
today so I would describe how hashes
worked how remailers worked the shaman
Alice to Bob to Charles to David
etcetera etc series of nested envelopes
and we even played a thing called the
crypto anarchy game which is I had
already written manifesto by that time
so I passed that out the meeting crypto
anarchist manifesto I basically dashed
off in under an hour before driving down
to Santa Barbara for a crypto conference
so the ideas were fully fermented and
fully developed a few anachronisms like
mention of K you banned satellites
course that echoes low Earth orbit
Iridium satellites that sort of thing
today yeah so back back in the back in
that like 25 guys how many of the guys
that we think of as an early cypherpunks
that worked on electronic cash like
Wadeye we're kind of physically there
participating or was it always removed
for those folks I've never met wait I
for a long time we didn't know whether
it was a female or a male people would
posit theories that way could be a
female name but we now believe it's a he
who believed he was a grad student at
University of Washington Seattle which
nick szabo also went to but to Nick's
knowledge they never intercept never
crossed paths with each other that's
really interesting I would have thought
that these guys were all a lot more
tightly connected than that that's
that's interesting
no I've never met Wade I and he's been
he's been out of crypto for many years
last
he was working on something completely
different ah Hal Finney
I knew through a group I was in called
the Extro pians group which is sort of a
cryonics live forever upload you're
bringing into a computer bla bla bla
right I was never into that wild stuff
but it was an interesting list of very
smart people Robin Hanson bean Tribble
Hal Finney Wade I was on that list and
it was run out of Los Angeles and it was
a fairly active group still exists but a
lot of these people are dreamers about
right unrealistic things I was pushing
the idea of cryptography as a plausible
near-term thing that could actually be
done and how Finney got very interested
in this and he was working for PGP at
the time Phil Zimmerman's company yep
coding it and he got very involved and
we had many many interesting debates
about it Wade I joined in on some of
this Nick Szabo was living in Portland
Oregon at the time and he he later told
me he explicitly moved to the Bay Area
just so he could be near the cypherpunks
meetings Wow so I've known L since
around 93 and I saw as recently as New
Year's Eve at a party and he lived
somewhere in the Bay Area Mountain View
I think he just got married but I've
known Nick since then yeah and you know
I can dispute all the rumors that he's a
law professor at George Washington
University and all that nonsense that
spreads out oh why here he lives in
Australia blah blah blah
no man ich lives in the Bay Area I saw
I've known that quite well he was in our
math group discussion that met in
Mountain View from around 2004 until
recently in fact it's still happening
it's a different group now but it's a
bunch of people who get together now on
Saturdays and talk about whatever comes
up self-driving cars deep-learning
quantum computers cryptography etc so
Nick I've known quite well how fini I
met a few times he was like I said in
Los Angeles and then in Santa Barbara
he's he's gone now yeah
whay Diane I never met but I
communicated only on the mailing list
with him and got him back he's in the
Bay Area no no he's in he is in Malta
and he spends some time in the Bay Area
because a company he works for has
offices in San Francisco Toronto Geneva
and Malta right oh I knew Adam when he
was a student in England someplace he
was getting his master's to time then he
got a PhD in cryptography and he was
very interested in the spam problem a
lot of these people were working on ways
to attach small amounts of digital
postage to things right to basically say
I'll pay you for your time to read this
message yep and formal cryptographers
like ron rivest were working on that
cypherpunks were very interested in that
and out of some of this came things like
digital gold bit bit gold Adam back
system so I would say of the does mean
4-way die nick szabo Hal Finney and Adam
back all were active when the
cypherpunks list yeah and then when the
cypherpunks list eventually devolved and
essentially after 9/11 a lot of people
got cold feet about participating in
something that dangerous right and and
then the arrests of Jim Bell oh that
didn't get as hardening so yeah yeah I
kind of that was one of the things I
wanted to ask you about was how how Jim
Bell was connected obviously interviewed
him not that long ago and it sounded
like he through kind of a securities
route ended up posting his assassination
politics how was that kind of received
by everybody on the cypherpunks mailing
list and what did you guys think of it
when you saw hmm not much I didn't
really participate in that I mean I'm
credited maybe by one of your works or
something that I had come up with the
idea of assassination markets I had not
it was I mentioned in the anarchist
manifesto that there could be audience
for assassinations right that's I mean
it was obvious that
if you had untraceable cash you could
that would enable certain types of
ransoms or assassin or hits on people
etc etc but certainly I didn't come up
with the assassination market idea in
fact that goes back to some of the Jack
London's work for more than a century
ago
Deadpool's and whatnot right right and I
think Jim acknowledges that yeah yeah
yeah yeah I need to go way back right I
think he sees it as like assassination
markets in general existed but his
particular sort of many-to-one
crowdsourcing of assassination is right
right innovation and I don't he
certainly didn't try to give you credit
or I didn't for coming up with the
assassination markets but I think he
said that they were being discussed
quite a bit before they were hosted they
were is that what what's your view on
how sort of in a in a voluntary aasaiya
tea like private security would work
because in my mind I the way that I've
trained to piece together the history
that's before my time is that there was
you know in in big sort of posts there
was Mises that did a lot of work on
economics and showing that you know
socialism didn't work the price
mechanism was absolutely necessary and
right so he would have been sort of like
the menorah kissed pillar array like the
Constitution and a limited government
pillar right and then at some point I
kind of give rothbard credit and maybe
maybe I'm missing some some dots along
the way for coming up with the idea of
privately funded security services and
privately funded defense that could
probably happen through insurance so
that it would be a very you know normal
sort of peaceful market operation a
little less a little less ugly and a
little more elegant assassination
politics is that how you think about it
or what are your thoughts on sort of the
help yeah I think that's I think that's
basically correct I mean the reason I
say I'm not a Ross party and is I
thought okay yeah that certainly makes a
lot of sense these things are going to
evolve right right so you you would you
had already bought into the idea of free
markets being able to replace all the
functions of
without necessarily needing rock board
to kind of spell out right right
applause right
in 92 but before before the cypherpunks
started I went over to a discussion
group a bunch of people I won't go
through their names but a bunch of very
smart people we're sitting around and we
were all reading a book by Bruce Benson
who's a very influential thinker who
wrote a big book on the economics I
can't even remember the name but you can
google on it yeah and I actually bought
the book and annotated it with a pen and
I find that often helps me to develop
ideas to simply write in the margins and
underline things and we had a
fascinating discussion and he basically
took a lot of Friedman's work and
extended it the core idea is that many
systems already run and arctic lee and
there's a famous system of maritime law
called the law merchant right which
deals with how ships from different
countries interact with each other
navigation wise etiquette trading
exchange or fuel-oil that sort of thing
and they work essentially Antarctica Lee
they work in a free market system and
it's worked for a long long time the
Hanseatic League for example started a
lot of this several centuries ago and
obviously probably it's been happening
for ten thousand years since modern
civilization started people interact
with trade they interact sometimes
there's a king who enforces certain laws
but for the most part people trade
freely oh right
more or less so Benson basically
explores the idea of how these private
enterprises could expand these a
collective defense agencies for example
and it certainly made a complete amount
of sense yep
what crypto did was say that people
anywhere around the world could interact
and here's something I constantly am
frustrated by nothing not a lot of
things frustrate me but I am frustrated
by the fact that people talk about legal
and illegal trends
actions in terms of a lens from the US
point of view right
and something I constantly talk about is
well think of all the things that you
could buy and trade on a Silk Road type
of market which we think of as perfectly
legal that are illegal and say Ireland
namely birth control information right
where any number of things in Saudi
Arabia which would get you beheaded for
saying or thinking or expanding upon so
I get tired of people talking about
illegally uses of Bitcoin when in fact
many of these uses any libertarian any
free thinking person would say of course
people should be allowed to publish what
they want to publish the printing press
Gutenberg all that stuff
yeah the first big Bitcoin revolution
and it's it's incorrect for us to think
parochially in terms of what's legal or
illegal any nada sabes yeah that's why I
make at a couple of conferences I I just
dashed off a list of enemies list
Mormons anti Mormons bootleggers etc etc
right just a list of all the people have
been enemies of the state in one way or
another and it's a long long list right
and that's just the United States if you
made a list of people that have been
enemies of any state it would include
every single human that's ever existed
because you've been an infidel of one
side or the other and every point in
history yeah yeah exactly yeah no that's
that's a that's a really good point so
yeah I do kind of feel like an
archaeologist a little bit trying to go
back in time and figure out who
originated these ideas and how they
connected Hayek for example I've read
him quite a bit I don't feel like I've
ever read him say anything that I didn't
already read in Mises but he he's he
popularized this stuff so much more and
was you know no won the Nobel Prize and
connected connected the dots in ways
that appealed people so much more that
it's it's interesting that trying to see
where this all this all came from but
but more importantly are the ideas
themselves of course right right right
right so yeah I am NOT a scholar of any
of these guys and basically the more I
read of these things they just drone on
about the same same old things right
yeah yeah so what about wit Diffie how
was he connected to the cyberpunk
movement obviously you know we owe him a
debt of gratitude for for the work that
he did on public key cryptography yeah
I've seen him twice at parties just in
the last three months oh really
so what his wife died last year so he's
been going to more more social events I
think science fiction parties a group of
us who've been gathering at parties for
50 years now I actually exchanged some
email with him maybe four or five months
ago when I was first starting to do the
podcast and he was really generously
respond but I was also kind of
disoriented because he didn't he didn't
seem to he didn't really want to talk
about politics much and not politics in
the sense of who were voting for but
just sort of ideological and I thought
that's a great that's maybe some of the
genius of the cyberpunk movement also is
that people were able to focus on what
they wanted to focus on and where things
align for action yeah I think to a lot
of staid cryptographers like wit we were
we were radical wild wild-eyed radicals
right and he he was more the academic
type connected with Stanford and RSA the
company and whatnot and I never heard
him ranting about libertarian ideas at
all I if if I were to guess what he is I
would assume he's a Democrat of some
sort yeah yeah yeah but at the same time
super productive obviously and very much
concerned about individual privacy
yeah he's written a book with Susan
Landau and and on digital privacy things
I think that was his focus for a while
at son when he was a distinguished
engineer there right yeah some more
conventional privacy points he's
obviously concerned about the
surveillance society we're building
right yes
up on on what's going on in sort of the
Bitcoin world obviously you know that
you know you know Manero exists and do
cash exists are you uh are you still
pretty interested in those things or
unfortunately I spend too many hours
each day checking the TWiT Twitter feeds
I'm not on Twitter but you know
obviously I read the archives or yeah so
I read a lot of this Adam back and yeah
yeah
Jake Applebaum's and those guys so I'm
caught up in the politics of some of the
stuff the ongoing battle with the
between the feminista that's one of the
advantages of being on Twitter is that
you can you can fill it you can add some
filters I'm sure you had to put some
pretty aggressive filters on old
cypherpunk mailing lists back then it's
not not too much different now although
it is it is I mean we had the time to
actually go off and people would think
about ideas and then write long essays
you don't see this today with this 41
repartee or 40 character
yeah yeah I actually got on
Twitter after I wrote the Bitcoin threat
model to try to get people to look at it
and I mean I gotta say I feel very very
honored that you took the time to even
peruse it so so someone's working to get
attention to it but it's not easy it's
not that it definitely takes a marketing
effort now to get somebody to look at
your stuff yeah wait well yeah and it's
it's just in in one ear out the other
people ask why I don't do more
interviews or s or why I don't write
more essays I say hey I wrote a lot of
stuff in 92 to 96 and it's out there and
it's been collected in places like
Vernor Vinge these true names yeah I
spent a lot of time I unfortunately
ended up filling about 40% of his book
but I wrote true names and and crypto
anarchy yeah true names of being a play
on true names and he said he liked the
result that I basically polished up a
lot of stuff I'd worked on for years so
yeah that probably represents my best
summary of my position on a lot of
things and I can't say I've I've had any
again breakthrough since then maybe I'm
getting older maybe the ideas are just
out there yeah whose tremendously
exciting in the first few years when I
like the alpha-particle thing when I
realize you know I'm the I'm one of the
few people in the universe who's
thinking along these lines right and was
very exciting so yeah I was I was going
to ask you about the alpha-particle
thing so I obviously don't understand
the physics at a deep level but one of
the things that struck me as I was
thinking about how that must have felt
is well how how important was that like
did that if that problem hadn't been
solved by you at that time do you think
it would have taken maybe a couple of
years for somebody else to solve it no I
think someone else would have figured it
out also I figured it out in February of
77 and we kept it a big secret for
fifteen months until I was allowed to
give the paper on it at a reliability
conference in San Diego yeah and I saw
people from our competitors racing to
the pay phones out in the lobby because
they had all been grappling with what
was causing strange random single-bit
errors right fifteen months is kind of a
long time if if it's one of those things
that's so critical that it's actually
slowing down progress of something as
central as maybe right right yeah
yeah well it wasn't slowing down to
manufacturing but the errors were
occurring and so obviously Intel put a
huge effort into this and they contacted
the glass and ceramic vendors I won't go
into detail but if you imagine a ceramic
mug on your desk a coffee mug yeah that
has ceramic and it may be clay that's
been fired and maybe some glaze and
glass on the surface yeah a lot of these
things have low levels of geranium and
thorium in them in the past sometimes
very very high levels they used to put
uranium into paint to make it brighter
right I was back in the 1920s big
scandals about it I mean it's not
dangerous but it's not a good thing to
do yeah I was sitting in my hot tub in
Sunnyvale and the walls were ceramic it
was an inground hot tub and the walls
were the kind of this clay type stuff
with a lot of little mica flecks in it
and I had a very wide-ranging background
just a bachelor's degree but I I took
geology classes and I'd obviously been
reading a lot of this stuff in my spare
time and I knew that Micah flex could be
dated how long a piece of pottery had
had when it was last in a fire because
the firewood Amil out any alpha tracks
in the mica from surrounding uranium and
thorium right so if the pot had been
broken and thrown into the bushes by
Indians say 400 years ago you could
count the fossil tracks could each this
in hydrofluoric acid and and the fossil
alpha tracks of where the alpha particle
had gone through the mica and disrupted
the local lattice structure could be
etched and you could count how many of
these things you could say okay I just
saw a 30 alpha tracks per square
centimeter we know that we're getting
you know so many many of the we expect
to see so many of these per year per
square centimeter based on the level you
can count this and say okay we then
think that this was last in a fire say
in sixteen hundred and fifty right so I
knew a lot about that kind of stuff and
I'm sitting in my hot tub I wasn't even
working on the problem and in the oral
history of Intel the later president and
chairman of the board of Intel Craig
Barrett was the guy who hired me into
Intel as his first engineer in 1974 and
he actually credits means is that Tim a
young bright engineer working for me
thought outside the box and he solved a
problem that a hundred other people at
Intel had been unable solve yeah so yes
that was what I'm a peak moment I mean
this is like looking into a liquid
helium Dewar and my professor saying
okay watch where I'm pulling a vacuum on
this watch the bubbling and through
through glass windows in the Dewar flask
he says right about now and all of a
sudden all bubbling stopped right
there's liquid helium it becomes super
fluid so that was a peak moment the
another peak moment was looking into a
spark chamber at SLAC at Stanford and
seeing that the actual particles two
feet below me and through a glass window
and then the alpha particle thing was
like climbing to the top of a mountain
where I realized Jesus Christ I know I
now know what's causing these problems
and I'm
the problem is a long-term problem and
to date there have been about 10,000
papers written on this topic
yeah and you you you were aware of the
problem and you were just kind of
thinking about it and you realize
sitting in the hot tub ah it could be
from the radioactive right being that so
that was like then I be I was
Valentine's Day I think February 14th or
something so then the very next day I
was so excited to go to work and I I
won't go into details but I took a bunch
of the parts that were having the big
problem and a bunch of the parts that
weren't having the problem and I thought
where do I where do we have a radiation
detector and obviously a Geiger counter
is not nearly sensitive enough that's
very high levels to detect that so I
went over to another building and and a
friend of mine was watching me helping
me out and I put some pieces into this
chamber closed the big lead chamber door
and hit the count button and counted for
a minute and the parts that weren't
having a problem showed very little
activity so when I put the parts that
we're having a problem into this chamber
and it pegged the excuse me it
makes the meter that is quite a crank
the range up 10x yeah and it still
pegged the meter these are vertical
levels these are not highly radioactive
things but and so I cranked it up and I
wrote all this in my lab notebook I kept
copious notes and I could see that there
were essentially something in these
parts that was radioactive and we now of
course know it's uranium thorium radium
all the dotter polonium all the daughter
products of radioactive decay yeah and
it's just you you hear about this all
the time you know the Granite's subways
in New York are slightly radioactive
right yep yep yeah what's incredible
about that story is that less than 24
hours from having the idea you were able
to measure it and see it and know that
you know it's problem was that's
something incredible yeah well that's
that that actually real needs to crypto
stuff I mean I'm an engineer at heart I
mean I guess I'm more a theoretical
physicist but I love the idea of
touching things I solved more than one
problem just by wandering out into the
production area to see how things were
actually working and I can't go into
details but we had a case where boards
were failing and a temperature cycling
and there had been a huge thrash force
that's what I used to call them task
force when I race trash for assistance
yeah you know want 20 people sitting in
a conference room talking about split
experiment let's manufacture 10 Tesla
cars this way and Tim this way and see
which ones crash right I liked seeing
causal connections actual physical
things so microscopes were always my
friend because I could sit there and
just peer at things and see what was
happening so I was assigned to this test
this is the first big thing I did in
1974 I was assigned to this thrash force
because they've made no progress in fact
they sent some of the managers over to
Malaysia to study their production line
to see what they could do expensive
trips all the way to Penang Malaysia
right well we're always the managers I
was never once sent out of the country
because I could usually solve things
myself I don't want to go off on a
tangent but I asked the guy who was
leading the memory division I said can I
go out and see this thing under action
and he said well why would you want to
do that well I want to see it so I went
out there and there was this again a
glass window door on this big
temperature cycling chamber imagine this
is cycling between winter conditions and
summer conditions right like below
freezing to 125 degrees C in this
chamber to stress the solder connections
all that kind of stuff right and I
looked in there and I said well Edie
this thing is going from hot conditions
to freezing conditions it's just you get
frost on the boards he said well sure
it's its low temperature
I said well Edie that means you're
running the boards underwater right at
some point I mean yeah between ice and
high temperatures you go through a
liquid phase right and sure enough
that's what the problem was and so I
solved it that day Wow yeah just just
just by looking at it and thinking
through at a molecular level really
what's going on with that right causally
just looking at it yeah just looking at
it right happening and crypto I mean
Eric and I realized that between the
onset of the internet and all the tools
like Perl little scripting languages the
could run things we were in this age
where people Alice and Bob could
communicate with each other and actually
deploy cryptography or deploy these
chowman remailer techniques or deploy
possibly some form of digital cache or
deploy steganography I invented this
thing we take the least significant bit
of say this audio file that you're
recording right now yep at least
significant bit I mean if you're
recording for example on your USB stick
or whatever 8-bit sound the lowest bid
on that is essentially operating at the
noise level the rustle of wind in the
background the noise and the lines if
you replace that with ones and zeros
that actually represented say an image
or a coded message saying attack at dawn
right this would open up new eras in
this call this is called steganography
it's like micro dot technology yep so
that was one of those things I invented
in 88 yeah that's what's such a damn
shame about the whole Bitcoin thing
there are people trying to get patents
on things like this Craig Wright guy
from Australia filing hundreds and
hundreds of patents of stuff that was
well trod ground even by 95 yeah yeah
absolutely yeah so this steganography is
hiding high instead of encrypting the
data with instead of encrypting the data
where you can't get to it you're you're
hiding it sort of in plain sight so it
could be an image a file or an audio
file just right in a place that's not
that looks innocuous it looks like noise
so yeah I wouldn't want to end this but
if you wanted to you could put your
Bitcoin private key in a photo and send
it to your friends yes you can pull it
out
absolutely absolutely yeah yeah yeah
there are all kinds of and of course
that's a you know well-covered territory
now but in 1988 it seemed kind of novel
at the time yeah yeah absolutely
so yeah these Craig right in these
characters they obviously take up a lot
of our time on Twitter and a lot of the
people that are interested in Bitcoin
have been fighting with these clowns for
for a while now well what are your
thoughts on on these guys I mean
I've I've very I've gone from like these
guys are just fraudster weirdos to man
this is just seems like too good of a
too good of a set up in a way to not be
well thought out so I really go back and
forth I don't know whether they're just
regular clowns or whether they're
they're part of something that's a
little more professional what's your
feel just kind of watching this all play
out some of the more respectable there's
a cryptographer from Australia Ian Ian
not even Goldberg but the other Ian Ian
G he goes by but which sounds like Ian
Goldberg but it's so he's a Bitcoin guy
yeah and he's a finance guy and has
works with Craig right I don't know his
take I've never met him but he's pretty
respectable yeah Roger ver certainly
made it shitload of money I first heard
of him some years ago with some friends
of mine active in the Bitcoin exchange
markets like crackin yeah
companies like that told me about this
guy who'd mortgaged his house and in San
Jose unbeknownst to his wife and
invested it all in Bitcoin right yeah
yeah
so he's of course known as Bitcoin Jesus
wandering the world right and he's
somehow involved in this he's involved
in Bitcoin cash yeah yeah he's I mean he
is arguably he's certainly been the
frontman for Bitcoin cash and probably
the only right Nexus with him in
particular I know that he you know he
has a lot of wealth but the him and
Craig right you know I I haven't really
even looked into the the other
Australian guy that you're talking about
but yeah Ian Greg okay
yeah yeah I think in gray I think the
names familiar but but I haven't really
spent that doesn't matter yeah but I
stay out of that stuff
Nick Szabo's wife was very active in
Bitcoin classic or you know aetherium
classic and just east classic so
interesting cerium had this big
controversial hard fork where they
rolled back history to retrieve some
money yeah
so Elaine al she writes for Bloomberg
and and she's Nick's wife now
she got active in theorem classic I have
nothing to do with any of these things
I've met metallic a couple of times
that's about it yeah yeah yeah the the I
wasn't really actively involved it was
doing software security work but not
really anything related crypto
currencies until maybe six months ago so
I I have the benefit of a lot of
hindsight but all of this stuff looked
really laughable to me when I showed up
like aetherium you know trying to do
Turing completes on the blockchain right
right right
if you were going to design something
stupid that would be in the top ten list
the whole Bitcoin cash thing looked
really laughable you know let's just
let's just let's just tweak a high
security parameter to get a linear
increase in throughput that's going to
be totally irrelevant and maybe it'll
break the whole thing like it's just it
didn't even see him yeah possible you
know yeah that's an area I'm very
interested in although it only is a
hobby I mean I don't to really get
involved in this stuff you need to be
immersed in it
all day every day thinking about it in
the back of your mind
right I'm very interested in ultra high
level languages like Haskell and I think
called Kok and I think called Agda these
are essentially theorem provers and
they're starting to show up in some of
the Bitcoin area there's a guy who was
recently hired by a block stream in
Russell O'Connor
yeah who's written a thing called
simplicity which is like 30 lines of
Haskell right it compiles into a smart
contract language and it avoids we think
a lot of these problems were
right gazillion lines of C code were
written that included reentrant errors
that yeah you know this is what caused
the theft of several hundred million
dollars of was a dab of stuff yeah yeah
and they're been in various of these
things in the past yeah another guy that
was extremely active on the cypherpunks
list his name Zucco ah you know Bryce
Wilcox you may know him is Zuko
journeyman etc he's busy cash guy yeah
yep and he's he's based off Colorado
someplace and
as a company principle of least
information exposure so he's one of the
leading guys today essentially I knew
him from around 97 to 2001 let me move
to the Colorado area right so he's very
active yep and he's done a lot of things
ooh COEs triangle for example so he's an
active person yeah and why this might be
an overstatement I guess I'll just get
your take on it but from what I've been
able to gather over the last few months
just looking at Bitcoin every time it
seems like there's an altcoin that's
doing something either it's just like
this laughable security design decision
that probably works good for marketing
but any any competent technologists
wouldn't see as buffoonery right off the
bat or it falls into right other
category where it's something that
probably the the really smart guys and
they're working on Bitcoin discovered
right and worked with a little bit and
just decided it wasn't ready like
confidential transactions on Manero or
you know even the ZK snark stuff yep z
cash you know it doesn't doesn't do us
any good to have a system that's secure
as long as we trust the people that set
it up like come on guys worry what I'm
doing is right when they had this whole
ceremony thing you know to distribute to
to make the keys for the ZK snork system
right right you may have heard about
that yeah yeah blowing laptops and
traveling around so it looks like
they're doing some interesting things of
course it's not just that Zuko did Z
cash it also came out of Matthew Green
and you know academic cryptographers at
johns hopkins and whatnot right yep and
I mean obviously that work is
interesting but but it does seem
surprisingly black and white to me as as
somebody that's gonna like be a user or
recommend something that looks like it
could become you know electronic cash
there doesn't like to be its it seems
like there's Bitcoin and then some
really you know you mention altcoins I
mean I think even worse or these icos
right yeah you know when stormy Daniels
is going to have her porn star coin it's
you know we're we've entered into we've
gone down the rabbit
yeah yeah so so you I know that you guys
had issues on the site for punk mailing
list with with people that were trying
to attack what you guys were doing and
they weren't trying to attack the
technology they were trying to do it
through politics or just you know
subverting sort of the the community
right like going in there and just
causing trouble training three different
factions when I look at something like
Bitcoin cash if if I wanted to really
disrupt progress in this space I one of
the things I would do is I would go
after sort of the ideological core which
would be the you know the ancap
libertarian guys then I would want to
split that into two kind of groups right
I would want to go and kind of get the
guys that were that are maybe into
economics more on one side and get the
technologists out of there because
you're not going to be able to really
cause any damage with the technologists
and then and then take the non
technologists and try to get them to
just confuse them in some way about the
technology to take advantage of them and
it seems like that is exactly what's
happened with Bitcoin cash where you
know they they had the memes of let the
market decide even though we're talking
about a critical security parameter
right like you know he said some things
or you know we don't need central
planners in in Bitcoin was another kind
of meme they pushed which of course you
know when you're talking about
architecture you do want somebody to
plan it you just don't want somebody to
plan the economy so it almost seems too
brilliant in some ways to do you feel
like it's do you feel like this is maybe
a like a well funded sponsored attack to
hurt Bitcoin or is it just some guys
that are trying to make some cash off of
some misinformation I have no idea
whatsoever yeah people ask me if I feel
regret that I didn't invest in Bitcoin I
said well let's put it this way when
Bitcoin when it took a hundred thousand
Bitcoin to buy a piece two pizzas or
something would I put money into that
maybe a hundred bucks whatever right I
mean I was meeting with Nick Szabo at
these weekly meetings I went to about
every third or fourth one in Mountain
View and Nick was pushing his idea of
proof of work you know which is
and I don't know if you've you probably
read a fair amount of his stuff right
yeah yep
okay he's an excellent writer but he had
this idea that if he could prove that he
did a certain amount of work like
painting a painting or and I use the
example well Nick if you prove that you
you've spent two years digging a ditch
in your backyard and then filling it
back in yeah I can believe you did a lot
of work but that's of no value to me and
I'm not gonna I'm not going to pay you
for that proof of work right right so
Nick never quite understood
squared the circle as it were connected
the dots too to show that something that
people prove they did a lot of work on
could be used could have value and that
was obviously the Satoshi Nakamoto
consensus right and why had achieved
value I don't know the earliest I would
have thought about putting some money
into Bitcoin would have been when it was
trading in the hundred five hundred
dollar range and it was there for a long
long time had some ups and downs you
know so today it's trading at around six
thousand 660 300 a third of what it was
in January yeah I don't believe in it
well how much money would I have put
into it right a lot of the people who
were babbling on on on reddit which is
worse than Twitter in many ways yeah one
doesn't know whether these are just you
know kids spending their allowance money
buying Bitcoin a scary number of people
saying I only have two years to go
before I own a Bitcoin right number one
that's meaningless you can have
fractions of a Bitcoin you don't have to
buy a Bitcoin yeah and number two it
tells people tells me that these are not
Roger Vera types these are what I put
say a million dollars in the Bitcoin
when it was trading it at $100 a share
no right because it was highly
speculative would I put it in when it
was three thousand no I have no use case
for buying a Bitcoin I don't believe
it's it's an asset one should holder but
I believe if I had a use case for
transferring money say to Austria I
might buy Bitcoin but I can usually
handle things just with bank transfers
perfectly fine so do you think
than gold and government dollars for
money do you think that money that's
good enough than it will get adopted as
global money and if it did certainly it
would go up in value of considerably it
could it could this case we're a Russian
plane lost a bunch of gold out of the
cargo hold
Zuko tweeted this or retweeted this a
zillion times saying the best best
argument for digital money ever made
right
you know bank banks transferring the
gold bars and having them land in the
snow-covered fields of Siberia yeah
there's something to it I know a lot of
major banks and central agencies are
thinking about Bitcoin in various forms
yeah and if if it was I mean it would be
the investment of obviously of a
lifetime if not of a millennium if the
entire world give up on their current
common store value and all went to this
thing that's only 21 million of them
that will ever exist could be could be
like a lot of people I'm not convinced
that Bitcoin in its current form is the
last word interesting well thank you and
I don't mean all coins I mean somebody
could just redo you know instead of
sha-256 someone could go Shaw 512 or
something and just you know from the
ground up and instead of 21 million
coins it could be a billion coins or
something right right yeah that would be
that seems like that would make sense if
it was if it was better but since it's
open-source doesn't it seem like we
would end up kind of adopting that
technology into Bitcoin yeah probably
yeah interesting and it's probably some
role for Bitcoin 2.0 I doubt that
Bitcoin cashes that role yeah certainly
I mean we've joshed Nick quite a bit
about you know the code is the law yeah
that didn't work out so great with a
couple of cases yeah or like there's a
current flap work
somebody says imagine that an aetherium
contract written in you know whatever
primitive language they were using for
smart contracts imagine that you have a
bank vault that
stuff in it and right next to it is a
giant red button saying don't press this
red button or it will lock the vault
permanently right guess what someone
pushed that button yeah and and so far
as I know that hundred million dollars
in aetherium is still sitting there
frozen right and there's much debate
about whether it can be retrieved so
much time is now passed that you can't
exactly just roll back history yeah well
duh they have they have done that with
the first Dow they did just roll back
history they just reset the whole yeah
and I think right more and more
aetherium as a community is making it
really clear that they're more than
happy to to do that and that they have
the power to do that I think the thing
that makes Bitcoin interesting to me is
that I don't think it could be done on
Bitcoin I don't think anybody has the
funding and I think the community is too
committed to not overwriting history
because that's where we yeah we aren't
even talking
you mentioned voluntary us yes Roger ver
is strong on that I mean to his credit
you know he's he's always talking about
voluntary systems the other thing that
was important for Bitcoin is that it's
permissionless right you don't need to
go to a banker or a central bank or
anybody you can just send money directly
there's no Vitalik that can erase your
balance or decide that you were doing
something nefarious yeah and again much
of what we think of as nefarious or evil
is is through the lens of our current US
law when we should be thinking about
global systems right yeah you know
imagine somebody in and Myanmar being
liquidated by the ruling Buddhist
government yeah and they want to
transfer money to say London but they
don't they can't go to a bank and do
that already have their heads chopped
off yep and if we help somebody like we
shall thinking them to wonder what his
values are I think the etherium
community is entirely too focused on him
and I don't mean this personally I just
mean it's this cult thing that's
happening and it happens in a lot of
areas and that's one reason I'm not
anxious to do interviews I see this guy
there's Bitcoin guru who says if you
want to see my next travel schedule
click on this site and he's like in
Athens
tomorrow Bangkok today after right in
Finland the following day and just
ranting preaching to the converted it's
just I think it's a waste of time I
think too many of these Bitcoin
conferences too many thought leaders who
never attended cypherpunks meetings
never wear at hackers conferences very
little involved in this they're now
entering as thought leaders meaning
sitting on panel discussions a lot of
them with banking backgrounds etc who
want to who want to provide what they
call adult supervision to Bitcoin right
yep absolutely nee Bitcoin governance
and all those and they want to
there's some talk of replacing the the
anarchic Bitcoin structure with with
more of these distributed Ledger's
morgan stanley's like that yeah sort of
approach the goldman sachs right
something they can control and guess
what we're back to just another PayPal
system yeah yeah it's just a Julian
Assange with the database yeah and so
it's nothing more than a database entry
system it's not even interesting it's
not a Merkel tree type thing by the way
Ralph Merkle was very active in all
these discussion groups way backs my
politics is well known but I mean it's
really creepy I mean yeah like people
talk about the singularity and a term
I've been using for that we're not going
to have a singularity in the VIN Jian
sense we're going to have a creakle
arity constant surveillance of
everything constant people in each
other's pockets constant instead of
people buying and selling things buying
products for example companies like
Facebook want to establish long-standing
relationships the sorry for example
occasionally we'll get an email saying
Tim and this is a robot writing this Tim
we notice you haven't logged into our
site in a long time yeah and that's just
it's creepy you know like it's creepy
they want ongoing relations where they
can buy and sell your data right yeah
well that's the revenue model yeah it's
a it's the the dream of any totalitarian
state as Facebook it just would give me
all of your data all of the time
everything all of your thoughts and
feelings and put it in a nice
index database so that I didn't yeah
we've seen what's happening with this
and we saw Zuckerberg basically what he
was still at Harvard said I can't
believe that all these people are giving
me their inner secret sending me photos
yeah they're crazy yeah and I
saw and just been quoting that paragraph
per se yeah yeah
yeah it's Zuckerberg has been watering
language attempted yeah attempted to
walk back those comments I hate that
walk back meaning change history right
yeah you know you know I didn't say
these people are morons yeah I
did say it but I didn't mean it well I
did mean it but I have changed yeah yeah
yeah like self-driving cars there's a
cartel of the lyft and uber and and and
Tesla people who want to provide adult
supervision in this and they've actually
proposed that individual civilians like
you or me could not use self-driving
cars in congested areas like New York or
San Francisco they want a cartel
basically oh you're kidding me if things
like Skype if they'd gone to the
regulators for permission they never
would have been allowed to do it plea
did it and then by then it was a fact on
the ground and it was the genie could
not be put back in the bottle right
because the regulators that represent
the incumbents would never allow for
that kind of disruption yeah and they'd
want a study yet create a working group
on it appoints and Senate committee to
look into it etc etc that's one of the
things we did but cypherpunks we knew we
didn't need any approval to do any of
this stuff we just did it so I was
active in the local Santa Cruz
libertarian party and again it was you
know I spent half a day sitting in front
of a supermarket sign signing people up
to register to vote including people who
said they were not even citizens I was
not allowed to screen them it was
basically up to the Registrar of Voters
to strike them off the list you know
some Russian guy had just arrived from
Russia
Freddie signs up to vote you know I knew
he wasn't eligible but anyway we had a
speaker come through town a guy named
Nolan of the Nolan chart in libertarian
circles that's kind of an XY axis system
of economic and personal liberty and
people can answer questions about things
and surprisingly as
surprising number and the interesting
number people end up on the libertarian
side just by answering these questions
right but this is early 1993 in Wired
magazine had just come out out with
three of us on the cover with hockey
masks to represent pseudonyms so no one
was there and we were having pizza and
beer one night and I was describing all
the stuff you know crypto Anarchy and
implementing libertarian ideas through
actual networks and technology he was
bored to tears he was just uninterested
and of course now many years later them
the people at reason and what not have
belatedly discovered that this thing
might be important a long long time the
the sort of the dichotomy between
political action / education and I feel
kind of weird because I've found myself
in that a little bit more mostly just
because there seems to be so much to
learn in this space that you know I'm
doing podcasts and things like this
mostly just to feed my own curiosity but
the the brilliance of sort of the
cyberpunk movement and the recognition
that know if you just put like you could
try to explain to somebody the
importance of capital investment but if
you just build a backhoe and sell it to
them they'll never dig a ditch the same
way again you don't have to make yeah I
was yeah people use a Heidegger not to
quote another theoretician but Heidegger
talks about readiness to hand like a
hammer has the property of ham earnest
everybody picks up a hammer and they
instinctively know how it works right
and that's called readiness to hand
there's some German word for it
so everybody understood how BitTorrent
worked it allowed them to copy music and
video yeah I was at a Trader Joe's
that's a local supermarket her
supermarket chain right and somebody was
setting up a card table a guy and a girl
obviously University type students and I
started to chat with him and I mentioned
oh yeah there's a guy who did some work
on this
BitTorrent Bram Cohen yeah and they both
lit up like roman candles and the girl
says you know
Braham and of course you know he was in
the cypherpunks movement I mean the
number of people who did interesting
things out of cypherpunks is you know a
long list and BitTorrent was something
people could understand intuitively how
it worked they'd set up a Bitcoin client
or a BitTorrent client and merrily start
transferring files and they didn't need
a centralized database like Napster had
a centralized database which was
obviously amenable to being shut down by
lawyers I never used BitTorrent because
obviously once you've created a
BitTorrent node you can be sued for
copyright infringement sort of the
optimism that I have around Bitcoin
being the thing that we're not we're not
looking for something to replace it but
it's it really checks all the boxes and
it really is functional and there's a
lot of FUD around it but the reality is
it works it absolutely works and it's
only growing better the number two
option on that list is so far below that
it's laughable correct and yeah and when
Silk Road came out I mean people readily
understood what it could be used for it
could be used for selling buying and
selling dope but not on the internet
right now it had flaws I mean we I wrote
about this other people wrote about this
a physical delivery flaw as soon as
you're getting packages in the mail
that's a point of failure yep yep but
but it worked at scale pretty well and
it was probably not a good Bitcoin that
that ended up causing the problem it was
it was probably you know the
surveillance state that we have but the
good news from my perspective on that is
that if Bitcoin is functional and we do
move more towards it the progress that's
been made on it in just the last six
months I know the price is down but the
the progress that's made made on the
technology side isn't incredible and the
amount of right major
you know governments that are now
talking about it favorably makes me
think that maybe it's hit the tipping
point or they're there they're willing
to go along i working title for the
novel that i was working on and i never
finished but that turned into the ideas
for the cypherpunks was degrees of
freedom so degrees of freedom is a
physics term or economics term it refers
to like how many moving parts a piece of
machinery has the cogs moving up and
down right and usually as as temperature
increases the system has
one more degrees of freedom so water
turns to steam etc yeah highly entropic
lots of degrees of freedom but I thought
it was an interesting pun I like puns on
on libertarian idea degrees of freedom
yeah I believe that what we are entering
into as with printing which is a common
touchstone and by the way this goes back
to what were the first things people
published after Gutenberg the first
things were obviously religious tracts
Bibles and whatnot right one of the
earliest things were how-to manuals how
to farm how to plow how to forge metal
how to make jewelry little hand books
the guilds who were the intellectual
property owners of the time often on
pain of death hated this they hated the
idea that the common man could now learn
to read and read a book about how to do
something right and it broke the power
of the guilds as the 15th century rolled
around that's I think the degrees of
freedom we're seeing with people able to
transact business on the Internet people
able to buy and sell stuff I i buy most
things i buy through amazon for example
have for 20 years and today when amazon
says you can't transact with us because
we found out that you're one of these
crypto-fascist
anarcho-capitalist types like PayPal has
been doing PayPal has been crossing
people off their list because they're
accused of being alright type people or
you know links to Tommy Lehren or
somebody like that this is you you
linked to these other people that we
think are bad people we're not we're
cancelling your account right yep all
the way back to Julian Assange you know
and WikiLeaks the embargo there
uh-huh he thanks them he thanks PayPal
he says thanks did it thanks to me being
cut off I started getting contributions
in Bitcoin and look look how much
they're worth now yeah yeah they've
funded more government leaks and good
solid reporting than probably anybody
else and you know what Sandra's on the
cypherpunks list yeah yeah yeah
absolutely yeah
yeah it's it's an incredible group of
folks that and that that's why I keep
getting you know I have my own projects
that I'm working on but I just keep
getting sucked back in because this is
just in a fascinating point in history
they'll look back on this this point in
history as a major turning point maybe
ya know the Industrial Revolution yeah
could be could be could be yeah we had
other people uh there's a famous science
fiction writer very prolific writer
named Charles Stross he came to the
cypherpunks list for the extra ins list
and incorporated a lot of the ideas and
it was novels and he writes about one
novel per year so we had a lot of
journalists at the time as you probably
know Steven Levy and a writer for The
Village Voice and that's how a lot of
early publicity happened people wanted
to write articles on this I think we're
now drowning in a echo chamber of too
many different channels and not enough
people in any one place to have sticking
power in those days it was an obvious
watering hole for a lot of people to
come to so we had 800 people in the
mailing list at one point yeah I think
probably there were about 20 core
contributors who wrote at least one
article per day or a couple per week
that thereabouts
yeah and a lot of them were very meaty
how Fanny Robin Hanson Nick Szabo right
and so it was it was a nice watering
hole at the time and people went off and
did things they would go off and not be
heard of for a while and then the next
thing you know Adam back would have some
new hashcash or how Finney would have
something do you feel like there is that
there's as much energy going into
when right now as there was back then or
do you just feel like Bitcoin is maybe
too narrow because for me it does seem
like Benjamin I think there's more
activity now so much so that it's hard
to keep up with it but increasingly I
think a lot of people are dropping off
of reddit they've seen what a cesspool
that is with different subreddits
devoted to Bitcoin cash or Bitcoin and
people being banned from the Bitcoin
subreddit because they made a favorable
remark about Bitcoin cash right it's
just really sleazy behavior yes huh yeah
I mean we had a lot of trolls on the
list we had people deliberately trying
to spam the list dimitri voulez's' when
apartment he would write these long
rants and whatnot and we never censored
these people we didn't have the power to
block these people right yeah we even
went to distributed lists there were at
one point five of them and gradually
they dropped off the radar screen and
just after 9/11 about a year later some
guy with a an Arabic sounding name riad
Wahby
from MIT created the cypherpunks at al
Qaeda dotnet saying I'm sorry I like
in-your-face politics but that's just
inviting too much FBI attention time for
me to move on to something different
yeah do you think that was a real person
or do you think that was somebody that
was working for a government agency
trying to I think he's a real person
he's I think he works in the Silicon
Valley now I think he ultimately got his
PhD and I think he works for Facebook or
somebody like that yeah when I heard
that story I assumed and I assumed that
this was how you thought about it too so
this is interesting I assumed you
thought that was some FBI agent setting
up a honeypot and gonna try to you know
expose all these crazy people and men
round him up
yeah could be could be in fact going
back to Jim Bell one reason I was not
ordered to fly to Seattle for the trial
of Jim Bell is that I didn't interact
with him an acquaintance of mine a
journalist named Declan McCullough
interacted with Jim Bell quite a bit
about assassination politics dialogue
with him and so Declan got subpoenaed to
testify for the prosecution at well at
Jim Bell's trial his second trial I
think he went to prison for a few months
for his first infraction I think pouring
some kind of powder down a chimney or
something of an IRS building and the
second and much more serious one was
somehow involving tracking FBI agents
acquaintances of mine actually forwarded
some stuff he'd gotten from the courts
showing that the head of the Seattle
office of the FBI wanted to get me you
know moi it couldn't get me on anything
because all I all I'd done was speech I
hadn't I had not done anything that was
prosecutable and they wanted to get you
but it's gonna be your association with
Jim Bell they were not that angry about
assassination politics no they were they
considered me an anarchist and obviously
the term anarchy is much more nuanced
than a lot of these people yep so in
fact Perry Metzker a very staid Krypton
cryptographer connected with something
on the East Coast did not even like the
name cypherpunks which I of course did
not invent dude Millhone came up with
that you know as a joke you guys are
just a bunch of cypher punks right Perry
wanted to be you know the cryptographic
research association something you know
button-down tie sort of thing more with
Diffie type approach right as opposed to
what attracted a lot of free thinkers
and radical types and our our camp yeah
so it definitely wouldn't be it you
wouldn't have to have much of a tinfoil
hat on to think that if if people were
willing you know if government agents
were willing to target you
back in those days just because you had
said things that they didn't like and
they associated it with the phrase
anarchy right that you know there's
there's a division or two or at least a
couple couple folks that are spending
some time trying to subvert the work
that's being done on a dead queen yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's another
reason I haven't bought Bitcoin I mean
somebody made this excellent point at
when when one is not even clear what the
laws are on these things then selective
prosecution can be applied yep yeah
absolutely
yeah that's interesting my my as a
couple of people that are that are
definitely libertarians I think we're
both probably more more afraid of
Bitcoin than the average person might my
main concern is I want to own some of it
and I want to support the community but
I don't want to own enough of it to
where it's worth kidnapping and killing
over and I think it's a pretty small
number I always tell people you know
there's less than $10,000 in cash at the
at the local bank so if you somehow
scrape together twenty five thousand
dollars an untraceable electronic cash
and now you're living in the suburbs
with no full-time security you may have
you may have pushed it too far because
you're yeah encourage things you know
people assuming that I must have Bitcoin
or something right yeah yeah and it does
no good to say no I just haven't
bothered with it right yeah because
nobody knows oh yeah yeah it's I mean
scary scary how stupid people can be and
especially kind of people that do that
sort of stuff yeah there have already
been cases of extortion some German
businessman was kidnapped and forced to
turn over his keys yep yep yeah what I
tell people is I believe that we will
have a system of private security and
insurance that will take care of these
sort of things and make them not
profitable attacks on people that might
own Bitcoin but we don't have it yet so
we got it be careful about how many
times these things yeah if I can give
you one piece of advice is is
concentrate less on the old Austrian
thinkers who obviously said right things
but so what it's just you know
free-market capitalism the book I'm
thinking of by Bruce Benson is called
the enterprise of law
no I will definitely read that right and
yeah I cannot tell you how fun this has
been for me I was excited to talk to you
like I was going for a job interview 20
years ago so this has been a blast and I
really really appreciate your time
turn off JW if you have any more
questions feel free to give me a call
absolutely
