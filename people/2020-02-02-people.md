It's rather ambitious to try and list all essential people from Bitcoin's history.

This is just a simple list that will move in that direction, and nothing like comprehensive

  > - Adam Back - 90s Cypherpunk, Inventor of HashCash, CEO of Blockstream

  > - Eric Hughes - Founding member of the Cypherpunk Mailing List,
  > - Gregory Maxwell - Bitcoin Core Developer, Blockstream CTO, Controversial figure to the Big Block political faction

We anthropomorphise these programs, and say "they" wish to cooperate without exposing themselves to unnecessary risks.
