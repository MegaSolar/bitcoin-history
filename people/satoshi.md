  > "Based on historical estimates, Satoshi likely started formalizing the Bitcoin concept sometime in late 2006 and started coding it around May 2007. In this same time span, many regulators began to believe that the U.S. housing market was overextended and likely in for a rough ride. 22 It’s hard to believe someone with such breadth of knowledge as Satoshi would be working in isolation from what he was witnessing in global financial markets.

  > As some might have noticed, one of the things that bugs me about bitcoin is that the entire history of transactions is completely public. I totally understand the benefits of how this simplifies things and makes it easy for everyone to prove coins are valid.

  > So this is not a suggestion for a change to bitcoin. Rather it is a question about what could be possible, and what couldn't be possible.

  > The general question is, could the block list be/have been implemented in a way that didn't store the full transactions in the list? Specifically, *perhaps* it would be possible to store only hashes of the in-points, out-points in the block list. These would be time stamped (notarized) in the blocklist exactly as is being done now.

  > Natural Language Processing tools were applied to the Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin paper to compare it to numerous cryptocurrency-related papers in an attempt to identify the true identity of the unknown Satoshi Nakamoto. There are two parts to the paper; the first part is stylometric analysis on the linguistic features generated and n-grams of each document in the corpus consisting of the relevant literature listed on Satoshi Nakamoto Institute and using machine learning models of the linguistic features to predict an author/authors on the Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin paper and his personal email texts. The second part is semantic similarity analysis where the content of each document in the corpus is compared in terms of semantic similarity number using the built-in functions in spaCy and gensim. The results from the two parts suggested which author/authors in the corpus are linguistically and semantically similar to Satoshi Nakamoto.

   > "Internet commercialization in itself is a _huge_ issue full of pitfall and opportunity: Mom & Pop BBS's, commercial MUDs, data banks, for-profit pirate and porn boards, etc. are springing up everywhere like weeds, opening a vast array of both needs of privacy and ways to abuse privacy. Remailers, digital cash, etc. won't become part of this Internet commerce way of life unless they are deployed soon, theoretical flaws and all, instead of waiting until The Perfect System comes along. Crypto- anarchy in the real world will be messy, "nature red in tooth and claw", not all nice and clean like it says in the math books. Most of thedebugging will be done not in any ivory tower, but by the bankruptcy of businesses who violate their customer's privacy, the confiscation of BBS operators who stray outside the laws of some jurisdication and screw up their privacy arrangements, etc. Anybody who thinks they can flesh out a protocol in secret and then deploy it, full-blown and working, is in for a world of hurt. For those who get their Pretty Good systems out there and used, there is vast potential for business growth -- think of the $trillions confiscated every year by governments around the world, for example."
