[Satoshi Nakamoto may have mined fewer bitcoins than previously thought.](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/new-research-claims-satoshi-mined-far-fewer-bitcoins-previously-thought/) - According to BitMEX Research

[Not a suggestion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=770.msg9074)
  > As some might have noticed, one of the things that bugs me about bitcoin is that the entire history of transactions is completely public. I totally understand the benefits of how this simplifies things and makes it easy for everyone to prove coins are valid.
  > 
  > So this is not a suggestion for a change to bitcoin. Rather it is a question about what could be possible, and what couldn't be possible.
  > 
  > The general question is, could the block list be/have been implemented in a way that didn't store the full transactions in the list? Specifically, *perhaps* it would be possible to store only hashes of the in-points, out-points in the block list. These would be time stamped (notarized) in the blocklist exactly as is being done now.
