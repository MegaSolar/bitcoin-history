* [Trusted Third Parties Are Security Holes - Nick Szabo (2001)](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/)
  > "Commercial security is a matter of solving the practical problems of business relationships such as privacy, integrity, protecting property, or detecting breach of contract. A security hole is any weakness that increases the risk of violating these goals. In this real world view of security, a problem does not dissapear because a designer assumes it away. The invocation or assumption in a security protocol design of a 'trusted third party' (TTP) or a 'trusted computing base' (TCB) controlled by a third party constitutes the introduction of a security hole into that design. The security hole will then need to be plugged by other means."
