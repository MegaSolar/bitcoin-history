## Early History [**^**](#contents)

* 2010, the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development [CSTD] proposed the introduction of [a technology-driven universal currency](http://unctad.org/Sections/wcmu/docs/ecn162010_Israel_en.pdf). A “BitMint” would allow users to transmit funds globally and carry them around on a usb stick.

In February of 2016, the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) published a report titled “[How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance?](http://www.unrisd.org/brett-scott)” The report discusses how Bitcoin could empower those in developing nations:
>* Bitcoin as a means to facilitate low-cost remittances for those seeking to transfer small amounts of money internationally.
>* Bitcoin as a means for an otherwise excluded individual to have a decentralized global bank account, accessible simply by downloading an open source wallet from the internet, rather than having to set up with a formal financial institution.
>* Bitcoin—or the technology that underpins it—subsequently providing the basis for a richer set of financial services.
