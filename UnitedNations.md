# Blockchain and the United Nations
**A Reasonably Comprehensive History of the United Nation's Involvement with Blockchain Tech**

* 2010, the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development [CSTD] proposed the introduction of [a technology-driven universal currency](http://unctad.org/Sections/wcmu/docs/ecn162010_Israel_en.pdf). A “BitMint” would allow users to transmit funds globally and carry them around on a usb stick.

## 2015

September 2015, [Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld). 
  * 17 Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) with 169 specific points between them. 
  * “to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner.” 
  * Prominently among the agenda’s goals is providing identification to the world, by 2030.

While the Agenda doesn't explicitly mention the words blockchain or distributed ledger, the SDGs have been at the heart of the UN's interest in blockchain. 
 
  * [The same month](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitnation-registers-first-refugees-on-the-blockchain) that the Agenda for Sustainable Development was released, Bitnation stepped forward to provide identification through a Blockchain Emergency ID (BE-ID); offering dispute resolution, and other needed services for refugees, including the issuance of BITNATION Bitcoin Debit Cards (BDC).
    * In 2014, [Bitnation](https://bitnation.co/) became the world’s first Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN) and hosted the first blockchain ID and Public Notary.

## 2016

In February of 2016, the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) published a report titled “[How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance?](http://www.unrisd.org/brett-scott)” The report discusses how Bitcoin could empower those in developing nations:
>* Bitcoin as a means to facilitate low-cost remittances for those seeking to transfer small amounts of money internationally.
>* Bitcoin as a means for an otherwise excluded individual to have a decentralized global bank account, accessible simply by downloading an open source wallet from the internet, rather than having to set up with a formal financial institution.
>* Bitcoin—or the technology that underpins it—subsequently providing the basis for a richer set of financial services.

May, [ID2020 summit](https://id2020.org/) was held at the UN headquarters. Representatives from over 50 tech firms, including a number of blockchain firms, to discuss providing identification to global citizens who do not otherwise have access to any. 
  * ID2020 is a not-for-profit organization founded by Accenture, Gavi, Microsoft and the Rockefeller Foundation with the goal of developing a comprehensive identification solution and, aligned with the UN-SDGs, to “provide legal identity to all, including birth registration, by 2030.”

The United Nations Development Programme ([UNDP](http://www.undp.org/)) is a global development network, active in 177 countries and territories. The goal of the UNDP is to eliminate poverty and reduce inequalities, helping countries to develop policies, leadership, institutional capabilities, and generally move forward the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN. 
  * UNDP began supporting blockchain initiatives including [Aid:Tech](https://tge.aid.technology/), in support of low-cost remittance services, and reducing fraud surrounding cash transfers to refugees. 
  * In Moldova, the UNDP conducted a trial with [EmerCoin](http://emercoin.com/) for blockchain managment of the UN car fleet.
  * The [Alternative Finance (AltFin) Lab](http://altfinlab.org/), via UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub for Europe and CIS, is exploring new financial technologies for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and have worked with AIDTech, Blockchain.com, and Bitspark.

[UNICEF Innovation Fund](http://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/) raised $9 million to invest in open source technologies for children. 
  * Funding innovators in developing countries to help them bring tested projects to a bigger market. 
  * Blockchain one of three key investment areas the innovation fund is targeting.

## 2017  

UN-World Food Programme (WFP) held a trial of an Ethereum based solution in Sindh, Pakistan. Via public blockchain and a smartphone client, families received WFP food and cash assistance.
  >“Blockchain can revolutionize the way WFP delivers assistance to vulnerable families across the globe. It can bring us closer to the people we serve and allow us to respond much faster” -[Farman Ali, from the WFP Karachi provincial office](https://insight.wfp.org/what-is-blockchain-and-how-is-it-connected-to-fighting-hunger-7f1b42da9fe)

The UNHCR’s biometric identification system enabled [Syrian refugees](https://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/blockchain-against-hunger-harnessing-technology-support-syrian-refugees) to purchase food from a local shop with a retina scan; giving WFP a complete record of transactions, eliminating costly\untrustworthy intermediaries.

### Blockchain for Impact
The UN’s Office for Project Services (UNOPS) appointed Yoshiyuki Yamamoto to be a special advisor for [UN engagement and blockchain technology](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-refugees-blockchain/u-n-glimpses-into-blockchain-future-with-eye-scan-payments-for-refugees-idUSKBN19C0BB). Early 2017, Yamamoto began meeting with members of various UN agencies to explore the idea of uniting the organization on a blockchain. Among the agencies working in the UN blockchain group are the WFP, UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Development Group (UNDG).

9/17 - The [Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development](http://www.blockchaincommission.org/) was established [at the United Nations](http://culthub.com/pr/blockchain-commission-blockchain-for-impact-launched-at-un-to-advance-the-sustainable-development-goals/9176). 
  * The commission instated [Blockchain for Impact](http://www.blockchainforimpact.org/) (BFI), a collaborative for the co-creation, application, and promotion of blockchain for a positive social benefit. 
  * [Among their projects](https://medium.com/@socialmedia_63108/un-appoints-new-member-to-its-blockchain-commission-for-sustainable-development-b17dfc15ef3) are food distribution systems, and an Ethereum payment system. The commission will host a yearly BFI summit in locations around the globe.
    >“The Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development envisions and encourages the development of radically creative decentralized solutions to issues including; conservation of natural resources, protection of the commons, empowerment of all communities, financial inclusion and security, public health and welfare, civic trust and protection of the integrity of democratic systems—all in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.”

11/17 - [Humanitarian Blockchain Summit](https://unite.un.org/techevents/humanitarian-blockchain) brought experts, scholars, and humanitarian practitioners together at the United Nations Headquarters; enlarging the discussion around using blockchain technology for pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals. 
  * The World Identity Network ([WIN](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/world-identity-network-launched-on-sir-richard-bransons-necker-island-this-week-300496195.html)), the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the UN Office of Information and Communications Technology (UN-OICT) announced a partnership to launch a pilot using blockchain to provide identification to children at risk for child trafficking. 

**Proper identification is at the core of every effort to combat human trafficking.**

Late 2017, UN Climate Conference hosted a [blockchain hackathon](https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/a-bitcoin-miner-and-an-environmentalist-walk-into-a-bar-bbdfb06a5232) where developers worked to build demos and explore solutions for tracking carbon emissions, carbon pricing, distributed energy infrastructure, monitoring land use, and more.


## 2018 
Early 2018, the UN [helped found](https://unfccc.int/news/un-supports-blockchain-technology-for-climate-action) the Climate Chain Coalition (CCC), composed of 25 organizations committed to the use of DLT for the benefit of the climate. 
  >“[[The coalition](https://www.coindesk.com/un-forms-blockchain-coalition-to-help-tackle-climate-change/)] will cooperate to support the rapid advancement of DLT solutions to address climate change across mitigation and adaptation through enhanced climate actions, including but not limited to the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of the impact of all sorts of intervention, and the mobilization of climate finance from diversified sources.” -

by this time the WFP’s Ethereum based trial, “[Building Blocks](https://bitsonline.com/united-nations-blockchain-refugees/),” had provided aid to over 100,000 Syrian refugees


### March 

Blockchain.com partnered with ArtFinLab, UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Economic Forum (WEF); committed to supporting sustainability, humanitarian, and environmental initiatives. 
  * This partnership produced a whitepaper: [The Future is Decentralized](https://www.blockchain.com/static/pdf/TheFutureisDecentralised.pdf), explaining blockchain, and how it's being used within the UN.
  
### April 

UN Centre for Trade Facilitation and E-Business (UN/CEFACT) [held a workshop](https://www.unece.org/31stuncefactforum_blockchain.html) to brainstorm on blockchain interoperability, and draft a [White Paper](https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublicreview/Public+Review%3A+Blockchain+Whitepaper) on blockchain trade facilitation
  * The mission of UN/CEFACT is to facilitate international trade and develop electronic business standards in both the public and private sector. To that end, their focus is on the “smart contract, electronic notary and decentralized process coordination”
