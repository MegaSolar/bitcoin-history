* [A genealogy of hacking](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/59776/1/GenealogyHackingSRO.pdf)
  > Abstract: Hacking is now a widely discussed and known phenomenon, but remains difficult to define and empirically identify because it has come to refer to many different, sometimes incompatible, material practices. This paper proposes genealogy as a framework for understanding hacking by briefly revisiting Foucault’s concept of genealogy and interpreting its perspectival stance through the feminist materialist concept of the situated observer. Using genealogy as a theoretical frame a history of hacking will be proposed in four phases. The first phase is the ‘prehistory’ of hacking in which four core practices were developed. The second phase is the ‘golden age of cracking’ in which hacking becomes a self-conscious identity and community and is for many identified with breaking into computers, even while non-cracking practices such as free software mature. The third phase sees hacking divide into a number of new practices even while old practices continue, including the rise of serious cybercrime, hacktivism, the division of Open Source and Free Software and hacking as an ethic of business and work. The final phase sees broad consciousness of state-sponsored hacking, the re-rise of hardware hacking in maker labs and hack spaces and the diffusion of hacking into a broad ‘clever’ practice. In conclusion it will be argued that hacking consists across all the practices surveyed of an interrogation of the rationality of information techno-cultures enacted by each hacker practice situating itself within a particular techno-culture and then using that techno-culture to change itself, both in changing potential actions that can be taken and changing the nature of the techno-culture itself.

  > An introduction to the document is followed by an examination of hacker organizational and social considerations to include a detailed listing of hacker communication mechanisms and listings of high profile hacker groups. Subsequent sections identify hacker targets and off-line techniques hackers use to supplement their intrusion capabilities, provide a descriptive listing of common hacker tools with Internet reference points, and furnish a listing of hacker references to include WWW sites, related books, magazines and movies.

  > The annual Harvard-Yale football game doesn’t really excite many college football fans, played as it is between two schools known more for intellectual than athletic prowess. So on November 30, 1982, during the 2nd quarter of the 99th meeting of the two teams, it was largely students and alumni of those two Ivy League colleges in the stands watching.
  > 
  > As the teams faced off after Harvard’s second touchdown, a strange noise drew the crowd’s attention to the sideline at midfield. Springing out of the turf and slowly growing was a black balloon. As it continued to inflate, stopping the game, a set of letters became clearly visible. “MIT” read the balloon, before it exploded with a bang and a swirl of white vapor.

GNU/Linux and the Open Source & Free Software movements arguably represent the greatest threat to Microsoft's way of life.

  > Today is the first day of DEF CON 27, arguably the world’s best known hacker convention. Each year, thousands of people interested in security (and/or the hacking thereof) travel to Las Vegas to learn and gather with like-minded community. Some also attend Black Hat, a related conference which is typically scheduled right before DEF CON, also in Las Vegas. Not everyone who identifies as a hacker or is part of hacker culture writes code or uses Stack Overflow, but we would expect a significant proportion to do so. Well over 25,000 people attended DEF CON in 2018, all located in Las Vegas. Can we see any differences in traffic to Stack Overflow during the days of DEF CON? What can we learn about the hacker community from traffic during that time?
