# History of Permissioned Ledgers

Primarily to be focused on the development of permissioned ledgers, but including some general enterprise stuffs while I get my timeline together.

Later there will be other files to cover some of the related stuff like history of enterprise initiatives (but almost why bother until there's more to write about than trials and ideas). Blockchain and the united nations is an interesting study.

I’m into blockchains, having been a founder and former COO of [Monax](https://monax.io/). Monax built [the first](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/14/bitbeat-blockchains-without-coins-stir-tensions-in-bitcoin-community/) open-source permissioned blockchain client in 2014. The design has since evolved into the market-leading Hyperledger Burrow permissioned Ethereum blockchain node. Burrow is presently the Hyperledger Project’s only Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and is used by Intel and IBM’s contributions to that project, Sawtooth and Fabric, to run EVMs on those codebases.
