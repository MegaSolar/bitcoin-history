# History of Permissioned Ledgers

Primarily to be focused on the development of permissioned ledgers, but including some general enterprise stuffs while I get my timeline together.

I used this space to prep for writing this article: 

* [The Times and History of Permissioned Ledgers](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/history-of-permissioned-ledgers)

I don't really feel like spending much more time on this.. I'll get around to making this a real space eventually, but preparing that article ^^^ satisfied my curiosity.. I'm just not interested enough in permissioned blockchain to focus a ton of energy here.

### Early use, and discussion of "Distributed Ledger"

* [Decentralized Anonymous Credentials](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/622.pdf)
  >"Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash and uses techniques — such as [...] a distributed transaction ledger" and later they even use the words "distributed ledger" together but informally

  > This article argues, however, that the key innovation of digital currencies is the ‘distributed ledger’ which allows a payment system to operate in an entirely decentralised way, without intermediaries such as banks.

### Monax - Eris  

—created the first permissioned blockchain

* $100,000 bounty [was announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/25sf4f/100000_bounty_for_software_platform_that_can/) for the creation of a software platform to replace the Bitcoin Foundation, out of concerns over a lack of transparency

I’m into blockchains, having been a founder and former COO of [Monax](https://monax.io/). Monax built [the first](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/14/bitbeat-blockchains-without-coins-stir-tensions-in-bitcoin-community/) open-source permissioned blockchain client in 2014. The design has since evolved into the market-leading Hyperledger Burrow permissioned Ethereum blockchain node. Burrow is presently the Hyperledger Project’s only Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and is used by Intel and IBM’s contributions to that project, Sawtooth and Fabric, to run EVMs on those codebases.

  > In response, Casey Kuhlman, Dennis McKinnon and Preston Byrne of Monax led an effort to create the worlds first Decentralized Autonomous Organization
* https://prestonbyrne.com/2014/10/25/introducing-eris-industries/
  - This became [Eris Industries](https://web.archive.org/web/20150213194226/https://erisindustries.com/), growing into an open-source [Distributed Application Software Stack](https://web.archive.org/web/20160411053017/https://blog.erisindustries.com/philosophy/2016/03/02/eris-and-tendermint/) including a distributed application server ([Decerver](https://web.archive.org/web/20150414200414/https://decerver.io/)), [ErisDB](https://web.archive.org/web/20151120220014/https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/),

They didn't win the bounty, but their open-source permissionable implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was submitted to the Hyperledger Foundation under the name [Burrow](https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/HIP_Burrowv2.pdf), and has helped any number of people and organizations experiment with a blockchain virtual machine.

## Hyperledger

* [The Hyper Ledger Transaction Protocol (HLTP) is protocol designed from the ground up to enable payments for the internet age](https://safenetforum.org/t/the-hyper-ledger-transaction-protocol-hltp-is-protocol-designed-from-the-ground-up-to-enable-payments-for-the-internet-age/660) 
  - original Hyperledger, IP later [sold to Digital Asset](https://hub.digitalasset.com/press-release/digital-asset-acquires-hyperledger-following-prior-acquisition-of-bits-of-proof) and given to the Hyperledger foundation.

  >"bureaucracies are so heavily invested in the expertise and importance of local regulations and standards that it’s extremely difficult for them to cut the Gordian knot and implement seamless global systems,” said Szabo. “So they keep trying to re-inject points of control, and thus points of vulnerability, into blockchains, e.g. through ‘permissioning’; but this nullifies their main benefits, which come from removing points of vulnerability.”
