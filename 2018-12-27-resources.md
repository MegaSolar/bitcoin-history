  > Conflicts within Bitcoin thus arise from entities who hold visions of the protocol that are mutually exclusive — and this leads to friction when these visions cannot be reconciled. Visions of Bitcoin are not static. Technological developments, practical realities and real-world events have shaped collective views. This post is an attempt to aggregate the various dominant narratives that have characterized Bitcoin throughout its 9-year history. This post builds on excellent prior work by Murad Mahmudov and Adam Taché, and we suggest you add that to your reading list.

He also speaks about what happens when money stops working, why censorship resistance was one of Bitcoin's most valuable characteristics from the start, and what possibilities lay in store with a global, voluntary financial system."

Most altcoins must be legitimately considered as bubbles that popped. The dead-cat bounces from the resulting decimation can be wicked.

### Death of Bitcoin

* [Bitcoin is not Dead](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/09/06/bitcoin-is-not-dead/#355f465b5bdd)
  > "The first recorded claim of bitcoin’s demise was in 2010, on a little-known blog that found itself posted on a record of “bitcoin obituaries” collected by 99Bitcoins, a bitcoin information site. While I consider myself among the first wave of bitcoin writers, having written my first article on the subject in 2011, this early claim of bitcoin’s death came when the cryptocurrency was valued at only $0.23. It is now worth almost $7,000."

### Timelines

* [Bitcoin History: Timeline, Origins and Founder](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bitcoin/bitcoin-history-14686578)
  > "The history of Bitcoin has been a turbulent one to say the least, and right now we're in one of the most turbulent periods in its history, as it has spent the entirety of 2018 falling further and further from its peak value of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.
  >
  > But something as uncertain as Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) was never going to be smooth sailing. Many tried a cryptographed digital currency before it, and they weren't able to fully crack it. Since Bitcoin became a reality nearly a decade ago, there have been some high highs and some low lows. For some Bitcoin owners, that's part of the appeal.
