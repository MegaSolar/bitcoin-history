  > Conflicts within Bitcoin thus arise from entities who hold visions of the protocol that are mutually exclusive — and this leads to friction when these visions cannot be reconciled. Visions of Bitcoin are not static. Technological developments, practical realities and real-world events have shaped collective views. This post is an attempt to aggregate the various dominant narratives that have characterized Bitcoin throughout its 9-year history. This post builds on excellent prior work by Murad Mahmudov and Adam Taché, and we suggest you add that to your reading list.

  > "Bitcoin, the landmark digital money and financial technology, has spawned a global social movement with utopian ambitions. The notion of a new currency, maintained by the computers of users around the world, has been the butt of many jokes, but that has not stopped it from growing into a technology worth billions of dollars, supported by the hordes of followers who have come to view it as the most important new idea since the creation of the Internet."
* [A finite monetary supply for Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki)
  > "Although it is widely believed that Satoshi was an inflation-hating goldbug he never said this, and in fact programmed Bitcoin's money supply to grow indefinitely, forever. He modeled the monetary supply as 4 gold mines being discovered per mibillenium (1024 years), with equal intervals between them, each one being depleted over the course of 140 years. This poses obvious problems, however. Prominent among them is the discussion on what to call 1 billion Bitcoin, which symbol color to use for it, and when wallet clients should switch to it by default. To combat this, this document proposes a controversial change: making Bitcoin's monetary supply finite."

### Death of Bitcoin

* [Bitcoin is not Dead](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/09/06/bitcoin-is-not-dead/#355f465b5bdd)
  > "The first recorded claim of bitcoin’s demise was in 2010, on a little-known blog that found itself posted on a record of “bitcoin obituaries” collected by 99Bitcoins, a bitcoin information site. While I consider myself among the first wave of bitcoin writers, having written my first article on the subject in 2011, this early claim of bitcoin’s death came when the cryptocurrency was valued at only $0.23. It is now worth almost $7,000."

### Timelines

  > "The history of Bitcoin has been a turbulent one to say the least, and right now we're in one of the most turbulent periods in its history, as it has spent the entirety of 2018 falling further and further from its peak value of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.
  >
  > But something as uncertain as Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) was never going to be smooth sailing. Many tried a cryptographed digital currency before it, and they weren't able to fully crack it. Since Bitcoin became a reality nearly a decade ago, there have been some high highs and some low lows. For some Bitcoin owners, that's part of the appeal.
  > 
  > But how did we get to where we are today with Bitcoin? How did it begin, what were its forebearers, and what have been the unexpected turns of the Bitcoin journey? Let's take a walk through the timeline and find out."
